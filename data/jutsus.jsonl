More often than employing his hands, B would wield his blades in and between various parts of his body. The first two are held in the hinge joint of his right and left arm, another between his shoulder blade and neck, one in his mouth, under his left armpit, another between the hip joint of his right, raised leg and the back leg of the same raised leg. As strange as it seems, Killer B is extremely skilled with these blades and this fighting style which he began adopting since a young age.[3] The most dangerous aspect of this style is the unpredictability of his movements, easily catching his opponents by surprise. He can spin in a manner similar to a buzz-saw, or else employing a series of unrelenting attacks switching the locations as well as the blades with which he attacks, leaving no openings for even a skilled Sharingan user like Sasuke Uchiha,[4] and a highly trained swordsman like Suigetsu H\u014dzuki, who remarked that the method of attack was completely unpredictable.[5] Killer B was also able to throw these swords from their normally awkward positions, either to hit his opponents from range, or to impale his opponent at close range and cause damage that would normally be lethal.[6]\nThe swords can be charged with lightning chakra to greatly increase their cutting power through high-frequency vibrations.[7] Because of the streamline shape of these swords, they serve as fairly good projectiles as well.[8] In the anime Killer B was able to use the Eight-Tails' tentacle to extend his reach for a surprise attack.[9]"}

Each is capable of tracking their intended target and producing a significant explosion proportional to size upon contact but as they emerge, they consume a substantial amount of clay from the original dragon, initially extracting it from the creature's tail. This ultimately limits the number that each C2 \"Dragon\" is capable of creating, before clay must be sacrificed from more vital areas, such as the body or wings. By using more clay, the missile's size and explosive power can be substantially increased.\nThe dragon can also produce clay mines at the expense of clay, that take the form of small spherical creatures, which can be subsequently manipulated to force opponents to fight in a limited space. This is achieved through the use of Tobi's Earth Release: Hiding Like a Mole Technique, to hide a large amount of these mines underground, without the opponents' knowledge to their exact location.

Users control the chains as they extend outwards from their body, most commonly to wrap around targets and restrain them.[2] The chains are extremely durable, enough that even the Nine-Tails would struggle to destroy them.[1] In the anime, in addition to physically binding targets, the chains are said to neutralise their target by binding and nullifying their chakra.[3] Depending on the number and the length of chains that users intend to produce, they may prefer to initially create only a few chains, which they send underground to split apart and spread around the area as needed, leaving their immediate surroundings uncluttered.[4]\n\nThe chains creating a barrier.The chains binding the Nine-Tails within Kushina's subconscious.1/2\nA barrier can be erected between two or more sealing chains, which is quite impregnable: Kushina Uzumaki creates such a barrier to not only prevent the Nine-Tails from escaping a defined area, but also to prevent the Third Hokage from entering it.[5] Because the chains are made of the user's chakra, the chains can be produced anywhere the user's chakra resides. When she was the Nine-Tails' jinch\u016briki, Kushina used the chains to bind the Nine-Tails within her subconscious,[6] and for this reason she never once lost control of its power.[1] After her death, some of Kushina's chakra was sealed within her son, Naruto Uzumaki, allowing her to produce the chains from his body in order to help him combat the Nine-Tails.[2]\nDuring the Fourth Shinobi World War, Karin awakens the ability to produce similar chains, which she uses to lash against and ultimately destroy a wooden opponent.

The cause of the illness is first determined by perceiving disturbances in the patient's chakra. Then, using a chakra scalpel, an incision is made near the affected part. Using their chakra, the medical-nin pushes a large volume of a medicinal fluid through the incision. The fluid then draws the poison out of the affected part(s) and serves as a medium through which the poison is suspended and then forced out of the person's body. This technique thus removes the poison, while simultaneously repairing the damage caused by the poison. The process itself is extremely painful and requires the subject to be restrained in order for the process to work. As such, it is considered a rather crude method to deal with pathogens and toxins, and only used in emergency. This technique only draws out most of the poison, not all of it, so the subject can potentially still be in danger, albeit not immediate. To fully treat the subject, an antidote is needed.\nAfter the agent is drawn out, it can be used to create an antidote or medicine after it has been analysed. This can then be given to the patient to ensure a complete recovery. This technique requires the utmost care and ability in diagnosis, incising and unmatched chakra control.

{"jutsu_name": "Dead Demon Consuming Seal", "jutsu_type": "Ninjutsu, F\u016binjutsu, Kinjutsu", "jutsu_description": "The Dead Demon Consuming Seal is a sealing technique developed by the Uzumaki clan to call upon the power of the Shinigami.[2] Its very existence is so secret that even Orochimaru knew nothing about it.[1]\n\nOverview[]\nAfter the hand seals are performed, the user's soul is partly separated from their body and suspended behind them. Behind their soul appears the Shinigami, which restrains their soul with its hair. Only the summoner is able to see the Shinigami at this point. After a few moments,[3] the Shinigami wraps its left arm with prayer beads and chants unintelligibly until a cursed seal appears on its arm. It then drives its arm into the summoner's soul, thus allowing the summoner to call upon the Shinigami to seal a target: the Shinigami's arm emerges from the summoner's body and grasps the target's soul.[1] When Hiruzen Sarutobi performs it, he is required to get close to his target in order to initiate the seal.[3] When Minato Namikaze performs it, he is able to remain at a distance.[4] Targets are able to see the Shinigami so long as it's in contact with their soul.[5]\nWhile the Shinigami grabs their soul, the target is immobilised, any jutsu they may be using are dispelled,[3] and they are prevented from performing additional jutsu.[5] With targets unable to escape or fight back, the summoner can remove and seal their soul. Hiruzen was able to seal multiple souls by using this technique in conjunction with the Shadow Clone Technique.[3] The sealing, however, is not necessarily complete nor automatic:\n\nWhen Minato uses it, he seals only the Nine-Tails' yin chakra, leaving its yang chakra alone.[6]\nWhen Hiruzen used it on Orochimaru, he had to rely on his own physical strength to extract Orochimaru's soul.[5] Because he lacked the strength to fully remove it,[7] he opted instead to only seal Orochimaru's arms, accomplished by having the Shinigami cut off the arms of Orochimaru's soul.[8]\nThe target's soul is sealed within the body of the summoner, represented by a swirl pattern on their torso that is similar in appearance to the Eight Trigrams Sealing Style.[3] In Minato's case, this sealing of the Nine-Tails' yin chakra into himself makes him its jinch\u016briki.[9] With the sealing completed, the Shinigami gradually starts consuming the summoner's soul.[8] The summoner can, with difficulty, continue moving and speaking, allowing them to finish any lingering business they may have, but they will die as soon as their soul has been fully consumed.[4] The souls of the summoner and their victim do not pass on to the Pure Land,[10] instead being trapped within the Shinigami's stomach, destined to fight each other for all eternity.[5]\nAlthough Orochimaru survives the sealing of his arms, his arms are paralysed, causing them to hang uselessly at his sides. This prevents him from performing hand seals and by extension most ninjutsu.[8] With time, he's able to regain limited use of the arms, but he's still left with a constant and extreme pain.[11] Orochimaru believes that Tsunade could heal his arms - something Tsunade does not deny - but she refuses to help him.[12] Ultimately, after his arms begin to rot, Orochimaru is forced to switch bodies or risk death.[13] He is able to make better use of the new body's arms,[14] but the jutsu he can use remain limited so long as his soul's arms are sealed within the Shinigami.[15]\n\n    Souls being released from the Shinigami's stomach.  \nSouls can only be freed from the Shinigami's stomach by using Dead Demon Consuming Seal: Release (\u5c4d\u9b3c\u5c01\u5c3d\u30fb\u89e3, Shiki F\u016bjin: Kai, English TV: Reaper Death Seal: Release).

If the individual wearing the mask slices open their own stomach, the Shinigami will do the same, and any souls inside it will be freed. However, the mask doesn't have any properties that will prevent its user from dying of that injury; when Orochimaru uses this to restore his arms, he survives the injury by switching bodies once again. With the other souls he frees from the Shinigami, Orochimaru is able to use the Impure World Reincarnation.[15]"}

If the Four Symbols Seals do not completely overlap with each other, this allows the enemy/spirit's chakra to merge with whoever they've been sealed into.[1] In the anime, this seal is intended to encourage tailed beasts to aid the jinch\u016briki they've been sealed within, as the more they provide chakra, the weaker the seal becomes, and thus the better their chance of freedom.[5]\n\n    The sealing altar.  \nMinato Namikaze used the Eight Trigrams Sealing Style to seal the Nine-Tails into his infant son, Naruto Uzumaki. Before Minato performed the seal, he summoned a ceremonial altar that he placed Naruto on.[6] Naruto's seal is located on his abdomen, but only becomes visible when he uses the Nine-Tails' chakra.[7] As an additional safety measure, Minato also sealed the chakra of himself and Naruto's mother, Kushina Uzumaki, into Naruto, who would appear before him under certain circumstances: Minato appears when the Nine-Tails nearly convinces Naruto to remove the seal, stops him from going through with it,[8] and then reinforces the seal;[9] Kushina appears when Naruto is trying to replace the Eight Trigrams Sealing Style with a new seal, and gives him the support he needs to tame the Nine-Tails.[10]\n\n     The Nine-Tails within Naruto's subconscious.  \nWhen Naruto wants to speak to the Nine-Tails, he enters a subconscious plane that resembles an underground complex, with pipes running along the ceiling and various hallways. The floor is flooded with a shallow layer of water; the Nine-Tails' growing influence over Naruto is sometimes depicted as the water level rising. The Nine-Tails itself is separated from the rest of this complex by a large cage; the bars of the cage are far enough apart for Naruto to walk between them,[11] but the Nine-Tails can only fit part of its claws through.[12] The cage's doors are secured by a sheet of parchment with \"seal\" (\u5c01) written on it, behind which is the cage's lock.[13] When the Nine-Tails sends its chakra to Naruto, a dark liquid leaks out from the cage towards him.[12]\n\n     Naruto preparing the key to the seal.  \nBecause the seal itself would naturally weaken over time, Minato created a key for it that can strengthen the seal when needed. He inscribed the key on the abdomen of the scroll toad, Gerotora, and sent it to Jiraiya for safekeeping. Jiraiya, believing that Minato wanted Naruto to use the Nine-Tails against some threat, instead uses the key to slightly weaken the seal, giving Naruto greater access to the Nine-Tails' chakra.[14] After this key is passed to Naruto, he uses it to remove the seal in preparation for replacing it with a stronger one.[13]"}

Neji Hy\u016bga, a member of a branch house, was able to learn this technique through mere observation, a testament to his genius. The moment before the Hy\u016bga is struck by an attack, they emit chakra from all of their body's tenketsu to block it. They then spin rapidly, repelling the attack (and anything else in the vicinity) away and creating a protective shield for as long as they continue to spin.[4] The greater the force of an attack, the greater the force with which it's repelled.[5] The user is capable of defending not only themselves but multiple people.[6]\nRevolving Heaven is meant to compensate for the blindspot of the Hy\u016bga's Byakugan.[7] But in this regard it is quite effective, leading Tenten to describe it as an absolute defence superior to the Shield of Sand.[4] While normally a short-range manoeuvre, with greater skill one can increase the range of the chakra shield as Hiashi Hy\u016bga can repel attackers from several feet away and did so with such force that it ploughed the ground around him, cratering the terrain he was on save for the location he was standing at.[8] The only effective means of countering the Revolving Heaven is to prevent the Hy\u016bga from spinning;[9] the anime sometimes depicts it being used without spinning.[10]"}

It is essentially a seventh step to the Eight Trigrams Sixty-Four Palms, doubling the previous barrage total and at twice the speed. To perform, the user crutches down while extending both arms outward, one in front and the other behind while angled like propeller blades. This adds another row of kanji to the envisioned Eight Trigrams symbol, extending the technique's perimeter. This technique is used to close off the flow of chakra through one hundred and twenty-eight chakra points of an opponent's Chakra Pathway System. This eliminates their ability to use chakra for quite some time and makes it difficult for them to move. Alternatively, it can be used to hit a great number of targets very quickly.\nOnce someone is within range of the user's field of divination, they assume a Gentle Fist stance and begin to deliver the attack:\n\nFirst, two consecutive strikes to make two.\nSecond, another two consecutive strikes to make four.\nThird, four consecutive strikes to make eight.\nFourth, eight consecutive strikes to make sixteen.\nFifth, sixteen consecutive strikes to make thirty-two.\nSixth, thirty-two consecutive strikes to make sixty-four.\nSeventh, sixty-four consecutive strikes in succession to make a total of one hundred and twenty-eight strikes."}

It is said to be a flawless taijutsu that has no openings in either attack or defence.[1]\nWhen using Frog Kata, the natural energy used by the practitioner to create senjutsu chakra also surrounds the user in an aura of that same natural energy. This aura can act as an extension of their body and cannot be seen by anyone other than those who have trained in senjutsu. By utilising the aura, the user can extend the range and force of their physical attacks. Strikes that seemingly or would normally miss will actually make contact with the target. Only users of Sage Mode can see or sense this aura's extension. Nothing else, not even the Rinnegan can see it. One punch has been shown to have enough force to cripple and completely finish off an opponent, not unlike Chakra Enhanced Strength.\nIn addition, the enhanced speed, reflexes and heightened chakra-sensing from Sage Mode, combined with the skilful body movements of Frog Kata, allows the practitioner to not only evade enemy strikes at the last possible moment, but accurately counterattack an opponent.[2]"}

Inner Sakura has the habit of saying \"Sh\u0101nnar\u014d!\" (\u3057\u3083\u30fc\u3093\u306a\u308d\u30fc). The phrase has no literal meaning, but is usually translated as \"Hell yeah!\", \"Hell no!\", or \"Damn it!\", depending on the situation. The English anime translates it as a forceful \"Cha!\" Inner Sakura is unique as it is in a way a second will within Sakura's mind.\nAlthough she appeared quite frequently at the start of the series, Inner Sakura all but disappeared midway through Part I, and rarely appears in Part II. The reason behind this is that she no longer needs to hide her true feelings or reactions behind a fake smile, finally allowing herself to truly say what is on her mind. However, because Inner Sakura usually possessed somewhat violent reactions to things, Sakura is now prone to violent outbursts, which is not helped by her chakra-enhanced strength, making her very scary if one upsets her, similar to her teacher Tsunade.\n\nUsage[]\nDuring the Ch\u016bnin Exams, Inner Sakura was strong enough to repel Ino from Sakura's body when she used the Mind Body Switch Technique on her. In many video games, Inner Sakura was made into a technique for Sakura due to her lack of techniques of her own early self in the series. In most appearances, Inner Sakura is a taijutsu where Sakura's inner feelings burst out and she unleashes all her strength on the target with one or more punches. However, Inner Sakura may also interact with Sakura or the opponent(s) as a clone or genjutsu, as shown with the Clone Combo, The Great Sakura, and the Twinkling Maiden's Heart."}

It is also referred to as the \"Eternal Youth and Immortality Technique\". It was developed in order to fuel his dream of acquiring all the knowledge in existence, a feat that cannot be achieved in a single lifetime.\n\nContents\n\n1 Usage\n2 Known Hosts or Candidates\n\n2.1 Hosts\n2.2 Candidates\n\n\n3 References\n\n\nUsage[]\nThe Living Corpse Reincarnation immortalises one's mind, transferring it to a stronger body before the current host rots. By repeating this process periodically, this effectively allows the user to remain in the realm of living, so long as they can keep the host body alive while residing within.\nOrochimaru can only perform this technique once every three years. It also seems that when the three years are almost over, he is forced to move into another host, as the previous one begins to weaken and reject him. Presumably, if he had a proper container, he could stay in the host for a full lifetime. The fact that he wanted to prepare Sasuke Uchiha and Kimimaro for the transfer before performing it reinforces this.\nTo perform this technique, Orochimaru reveals his true form: a gigantic white snake composed of smaller white snakes, by abandoning his current host's body. Orochimaru then swallows the new host and takes him or her to a separate, mental plane where he envelops the mind of his victim. The snake body then dies and falls apart, and Orochimaru's soul dominates the body (though the Sharingan seems to be able to reverse the process against Orochimaru, which also grants the host Orochimaru's supply of chakra and powers). The souls of the hosts are kept alive within Orochimaru, leaving them \"still alive\", in a sense (albeit suppressed), and when Orochimaru switches hosts, the souls leave with him. Apparently if the host of these souls' chakra level falls enough it is possible for them to resurface in material form as seen with Orochimaru surfacing with his Eight Branches Technique after Sasuke used up most of his chakra.\nAfter taking over another body, Orochimaru modifies it to suit his theme of snakes, in order to increase his survival capabilities, such as stretching and bending his body, reconnecting any severed parts, and shedding his skin to heal injuries. This ensures that if Orochimaru cannot transfer to another body within the three years' time, he can allow his current one to greatly heal and evade attacks, rendering it virtually immortal; Sasuke refers this as the \"Power of the White Snake\" (\u767d\u86c7\u306e\u529b, Shirohebi no Chikara).[2] Orochimaru also alters the face of his host to look like his original form.\nAfter being revived through the Evil Releasing Method, Orochimaru seemingly circumvented this process, emerging in a slightly different snake form and then slithering into a White Zetsu clone's mouth.[3]\n\nKnown Hosts or Candidates[]\nHosts[]\nUnknown person \u2014 when Orochimaru uses his Living Corpse Reincarnation on Sasuke, one of his past hosts is seen in Orochimaru and Sasuke's mental plane.\nUnknown person \u2014 when Orochimaru uses his Living Corpse Reincarnation on Sasuke, another one of his past hosts is seen in Orochimaru and Sasuke's mental plane.\nUnknown female \u2014 for replacing the hand Itachi Uchiha severed; left body to escape the effects of his arms being sealed away.\nGen'y\u016bmaru \u2014 a desperate temporary replacement body before Sasuke Uchiha; left body for Sasuke Uchiha.\nSasuke Uchiha \u2014 after having been absorbed by Sasuke when he reversed his Living Corpse Reincarnation technique, took over due to Itachi's battle with his brother lowering Sasuke's chakra enough for Orochimaru to gain control; was sealed away by Itachi.\nWhite Zetsu Clone \u2014 for the cells of Hashirama Senju, as well as to escape the fatal injury of releasing the Dead Demon Consuming Seal.[3]\nCandidates[]\nItachi Uchiha \u2014 for the Sharingan; failed due to Orochimaru being unable to defeat him.\nKimimaro \u2014 for the Shikotsumyaku; rejected due to terminal disease.\nGuren \u2014 for the Crystal Release; rejected due to being too late and loss of interest.(anime only)\nSasuke Uchiha \u2014 for the Sharingan; postponed due to being overpowered by Sasuke, then sealed away before another of his consciousnesses was released by the Evil Releasing Method.\nReferences[]\n\n\u2191 T\u014d no Sho, page 270\n\n\u2191 Naruto chapter 365, page 8\n\n\u2191 3.0 3.1 Naruto chapter 618, page 15"}

His original idea is to create an Earth-Style Wall to reach that altitude, but he doesn't believe he would have enough chakra to make it tall enough. For this reason he recruits Yamato to assist him. They practice all night to synchronise Kakashi's Earth Release with Yamato's Wood Release, finding a configuration that is structurally sound but that also will reach the intended elevation within the one hour they'll be allotted.\nThe Spiralling Tower originally works as intended, with Kakashi's earth pillar and Yamato's wood pillar entwining in order to fortify each other as they grow into the sky. But a rainstorm begins shortly after they start, forcing Kakashi to spend additional chakra to reinforce the earth pillar against the rain and wind. The task eventually becomes too much for him and he loses sync with Yamato, briefly halting the tower's growth and potentially risking its destruction. Gaara and Kurotsuchi, whose assistance Kakashi requested the night before, arrive in time to assist, stabilising the tower that has been created so far and adding a sand pillar from Gaara and a second earth pillar from Kurotsuchi to its continued entwining growth.\nThe Spiralling Tower ends up being a success, with the three-man team that was ascending it reaching their destination in time. At the conclusion of the three's mission, an impact at the peak topples the tower and causes debris to start falling on Konoha. Gaara attempts to use his sand to shield the village, but he has no additional chakra to do so. A separate team of six ninja assembled specifically to deal with this potential debris begins to repel the initial chunks of the tower, but they are quickly overwhelmed. It is ultimately the Seventh Hokage who destroys the majority of the debris, saving the village."}

{"jutsu_name": "Tree Climbing Practice", "jutsu_type": "General skill", "jutsu_description": "Tree Climbing Practice is a training method used to gain more skills with chakra control. This training involves focusing a fixed amount of chakra to the bottom of one's feet, and using that to climb a tree without using one's hands. If the stream of chakra is too weak, the user will lose their footing on the tree and fall off. If it is too strong, the user will be pushed away from the tree, causing the tree to fracture around the point of contact and the user will fall. The concept of this exercise is similar to magnetics. This is evidenced when Sasuke was able to attract a kunai Naruto threw his direction to his feet and then throw it at an enemy by kicking the kunai while releasing his chakra's hold on the kunai."}
{"jutsu_name": "Transformation Technique", "jutsu_type": "Ninjutsu, General skill", "jutsu_description": "The Transformation Technique allows the user to take the appearance of whatever they choose. \n\nOverview[]\nThis technique is most often used to disguise the user as another person, but they can also turn into an animal, plant, or inanimate object;[1] according to Sasuke Retsuden, inanimate objects are the most difficult to transform into, and users are shown familiarising themselves with an object's weight and feel before assuming its form. Users will gain the attributes and physical features of whatever they transform into, such as a weapon's sharpness or an animal's fangs.[2][3] To be able to assume so many different forms makes this technique invaluable for not just combat, but intelligence gathering and diversionary tactics as well.[1] In Sasuke Shinden, some transformations are shown to take some getting used to, such as if the assumed form has a different height than the user or if the assumed form wears clothes that the user isn't accustomed to.\nBeing able to use the Transformation Technique does not necessarily mean one can use it well. Ideally, the user's transformation should be indistinguishable from the original, so that if they were placed together they could not be told apart. Inexperienced users, particularly Academy students, will often have obvious discrepancies in their transformations, making them useless for deception.[1] Even practised users, though their transformations may lack any serious flaws, can overlook small details of whoever they're impersonating (such as minor scrapes or blemishes), thus enabling careful observers to expose them as impostors. Even if a transformation is a perfect likeness, users can still inadvertently reveal themselves if they don't act the same way as their subject.[4] Users can also be identified as fakes if their scent is wrong.[5]\nWhen a transformed user has been found out and attacked, they ordinarily allow the transformation to dispel. Some users may maintain the transformation in a final attempt to keep their cover, only dispelling the transformation once this effort fails.[4] Still other users may, when they seem to be dispelling the transformation, actually take another transformation altogether, confusing opponents as to their true identity. Seemingly the only way to reliably find out if somebody is using the Transformation Technique is to knock them unconscious, which will cause the transformation to dissolve.[6]\nTsunade uses the Transformation Technique to constantly appear several decades younger, keeping it active regardless of where she is or what she's doing. She only reverts to her original form when she no longer has the chakra to maintain her transformation.[7] In the anime, Kager\u014d also keeps her Transformation Technique active for long periods of time, taking the form of a buck-toothed, hunchbacked man.[8] In Akatsuki Hiden, the citizens of Shangri-la use the Transformation Technique at all times in a concerted effort to make new lives for themselves; their transformations only dispel when they die."}

In an attempt to retrieve the chakra bestowed upon her two sons, she imparted her will upon the God Tree and  \u2014 along with all the people tethered to it \u2014  created what then became the Ten-Tails.[1] Titanic in size, she was able to use its power to fight her children for a length of months.\nImmediately prior to being sealed by Hagoromo and Hamura, Kaguya \u014ctsutsuki formulated a plan that would result in her eventual revival. To accomplish this, she created a sentient being known as Black Zetsu, which would spend centuries fulfilling her desire.[2][3] Created as a malleable construct, Black Zetsu is capable of controlling the actions of others by coating itself over their bodies and taking possession of them.[4] Once the remnants of her chakra were finally reunited, Black Zetsu was able to revive her within a new host, Madara Uchiha. It was also capable of manipulating the husk of the Ten-Tails, extracting a number of White Zetsu from it.\n\nMadara Uchiha[]\nMadara Uchiha was also capable of using this ability. Moments prior to his death, he attempted to infuse his will into the right half of White Zetsu, seemingly creating Black Zetsu, which he referred to as a weaker version of himself; in actuality, Black Zetsu merely made it look like it was being created as part of its plan. \nMadara was actually able to impart his will into the black rod that emerged from the flowering tree he was attached to in his old age. Revealing it to Obito, Madara claimed that it was a physical manifestation of his will and that it should be used when performing the Six Paths Technique.[5]\nOn a later occasion, following his resurrection, Madara caused a number of these black rods to emerge from Obito's artificial right half, which became entirely coated in a black substance similar to Black Zetsu.[6] This allowed Madara to remotely control Obito's actions using his chakra, as well as fire black rods out of his body as projectiles, though Obito was ultimately able to resist his control.[7]\n\nReferences[]\n\n\u2191 Naruto chapter 681, page 9\n\n\u2191 Naruto chapter 678, pages 14-16\n\n\u2191 Naruto chapter 681, page 8\n\n\u2191 Naruto chapter 656, page 16\n\n\u2191 Naruto chapter 606, pages 15-16\n\n\u2191 Naruto chapter 636, pages 15-17\n\n\u2191 Naruto chapter 637"}

Neji Hy\u016bga was able to free himself by simultaneously releasing chakra from all of his tenketsu, destroying the prison.[5] In Akatsuki Hiden, Kisame Hoshigaki escaped by increasing the volume of water within the prison beyond what it could contain, causing it to burst.\nIn order to maintain the prison, users must stay in contact with the sphere, typically by keeping an arm submerged within it. For this reason, water clones can be used in combination with water prisons, either by having the water clone attack other targets while the user maintains the prison,[6] or by having the clones themselves form the prisons, leaving the user free to act. In cases where a water clone forms the water prison, the water of the clone's body can be used as a source for the prison.[4] In the anime, this contact is shown to not be necessary, allowing users to trap targets from a distance,[7] and can draw in other people to trap upon contact with it.[8]\nThe water prison's usefulness has caused it to be adapted for other purposes. It can be stored in scrolls, trapping anyone who tries to read their contents without permission.[9] Alternatively, users can confine themselves within a water prison, thus preventing opponents from reaching them.[3]"}

The jinch\u016briki will use the raw chakra of the their Tailed Beast to form arms, which they can freely manipulate to attack their foes, able to strike an opponent faster than even a Sharingan user can react to.[2] The chakra arms' hands are clawed while the rest of the arm seems to lack any kind of joint, thus allowing them to have flexible movements that will generally be impossible for normal arms. The user can create any number of arms that they desire and they can also serve other purposes such as grappling hooks, to either grab onto objects or enemies from great distances, for offensive means, as merely touching one of these can cause fatal burns, due to the Nine-Tails' seething hatred within its chakra (though this is not always the case). Due to having chakra attached to his body, the chakra arms can grow in size and from the fourth tail up, Naruto, the arms, or any part of his body can divide into two or more fully operational appendages.[3] Killer B has also been shown to use this technique though instead of arms, he can form horns which he uses for his Lightning Release: Lariat technique.[4]\nIn his Nine-Tails Chakra Mode, Naruto can use the chakra arms to a greater extent, as he can use and release chakra arms from anywhere on his body on a small or large scale. These arms even have the power to crush stone without Naruto putting much thought into it.[5] In the anime Naruto was able to crush a sword with a chakra arm just by tightening his grip.[6] After some practice, he mastered the chakra arms, able to manipulate various stones and geometric shapes without crushing them.[7] Now he is able to use them in an attempt to create a new technique: the Tailed Beast Rasengan since he was advised by the Eight-Tails against the use of shadow clones in this form.[8] Naruto's mastery of the Tailed Beast Chakra Arms is so great that he is able to create several at once to launch attacks at several enemies, use them to pull enemies into the attack, and even create tiny ones around his finger. The arms also grant him a greater level of dexterity and manoeuvrability out of what would normally be a helpless situation,[9] such as guiding his Rasenshuriken during his fight against the Third Raikage. Not only that, Naruto can control each individual shroud he gives out to protect his allies."}

The oesophagus is summoned around a target; if this is done inside a cave or some other structure, it's possible the target will not even notice. The walls of the oesophagus are sticky and pliable, making it difficult for opponents to keep their footing and, therefore, fight as normal. The oesophagus is ordinarily inescapable, and over time it will contract around and digest its victims.[1]\nJiraiya can control the oesophagus, causing it to expand, contract, or grow in whatever direction he wishes. When first used, Jiraiya claims that no one has ever escaped from this technique. Itachi Uchiha and Kisame Hoshigaki manage to escape when Itachi burns through the oesophagus using Amaterasu. This surprises Jiraiya, as the oesophagus is fire-resistant due to the toad's ability to breathe fire.[2]\nIn the anime, Jiraiya demonstrates the ability to summon a giant toad's stomach using this technique. This section of the toad contains stomach acid, and the air within is filled with an acidic poison that is colourless and odourless, making it difficult to detect. Though it can be endured in small amounts, this poison begins to paralyse a person's entire body after ten minutes of continuous exposure, indiscriminately affecting anyone contained within the stomach.[3]"}

He also uses the jutsu to dodge enemy attacks and free himself from restraints. He is still able to use K\u0101ma's absorption in his shrunken state. He can also use the shrinking effect defensively against that which K\u0101ma cannot absorb, such as reducing natural (non-chakra) flames that were engulfing him to a small size. The shrinkage is not limited to an object's entirety, as Isshiki can shrink a section of the target object, such as causing a building to cave in or removing a section of a rooftop.\nWhile inhabiting Jigen's body, this jutsu demanded that Isshiki make hand gestures in order to shrink foreign matter, but in his original form, Isshiki can achieve the effect merely by looking at desired objects."}

This extra chakra will allow the user to utilise high level element ninjutsu. It also allows the user to use elemental techniques that they wouldn't be able to master normally. The chakra is not infinite, and must be replenished over time. Furthermore, only one type of elemental chakra can be injected into the person at a time, as Neji noted that Shizuku was seen with a completely different element from the previous encounter.\nThe person injected with these snakes can also force the snake out, and drink the chakra directly, vastly increasing their chakra and power, as well as inducing a body-mutating transformation (in Gitai's case, he became an Asura-like entity, with three faces, six-arms and a tail), but results in their body being highly unstable, which, if struck with sufficient force, can result in the body exploding.\nThe dark chakra snakes can also be used against the opponents.

To account for this, Kid\u014dmaru modifies the arrowhead into a drill, which will allow it to pierce through the tree if Neji tries that again.[3] The combination of the new arrow and the guiding thread is enough to successfully strike Neji, which Neji uses as an opportunity to locate and kill Kid\u014dmaru.[4] In the anime, after being reincarnated, Kid\u014dmaru can simultaneously fire three arrows.[5]"}

{"jutsu_name": "Six Paths Technique", "jutsu_type": "Kekkei Genkai, Ninjutsu, D\u014djutsu", "jutsu_description": "This article is about the original technique granted by the Rinnegan. For the technique which uses different bodies, see Six Paths of Pain.\n\n\n\n\nThe Six Paths Technique (\u516d\u9053\u306e\u8853, Rikud\u014d no Jutsu) is the origin of the unique techniques bestowed by the Rinnegan. Those who wield the Rinnegan have access to each of these techniques.[2] Despite its name, there are actually seven of these techniques that grant the user powerful and near god-like abilities:\n\nThe Deva Path (\u5929\u9053, Tend\u014d), which is able to manipulate attractive and repulsive forces.\nThe Asura Path (\u4fee\u7f85\u9053, Shurad\u014d), which allows the user to augment their body with mechanised limbs, weaponry and armour.\nThe Human Path (\u4eba\u9593\u9053, Ningend\u014d), which affords the ability to read a person's mind while also removing their soul.\nThe Animal Path (\u755c\u751f\u9053, Chikush\u014dd\u014d), which allows the user to summon a wide variety of creatures.\nThe Preta Path (\u9913\u9b3c\u9053, Gakid\u014d), which is capable of absorbing all forms of chakra, including most ninjutsu.\nThe Naraka Path (\u5730\u7344\u9053, Jigokud\u014d), through which the user can call upon the King of Hell.\nThe Outer Path (\u5916\u9053, Ged\u014d), with which the user is able to preside over life and death.\nNagato, who was crippled early in his lifetime, utilised the Outer Path to create the Six Paths of Pain: six reanimated corpses that he controlled as additional bodies through the use of black receivers. These bodies each possessed copies of the Rinnegan and the ability to use one aspect of the Six Paths Technique, thus compensating for Nagato's physical limitations. The Six Paths of Pain were each named after the ability Nagato channelled through them, while Nagato himself was regarded as the seventh Pain, the Outer Path.[2] Obito Uchiha would later make use of this method to create his own Six Paths of Pain, this time using six former jinch\u016briki that were reincarnated by Kabuto Yakushi.[3]\nAs the main body's vision is linked to the Rinnegan possessed by the corpses, this method allows the user to easily coordinate their movements and also offers them a form of protection, as they can control the corpses from a distance, rather than putting their own body at risk. However, in order to use some especially chakra-taxing facets of the Six Paths Technique, the user must either cut off the flow of their chakra to all but one body, as in the case of the large-scale Shinra Tensei,[4] or bring the body close to their position, as in the case of Chibaku Tensei.[5] In contrast, when a Rinnegan wielder uses the Six Paths Technique with their own body, they are capable of using multiple abilities at once, and the strength of the techniques are greater.[6] It also does not seem that the user is able to change the Path being utilised by each body, as once each of Nagato's Six Paths were taken down, he could not channel any of their powers through the remaining vessels.\n\nInfluences[]\nThe Six Paths share their names with the six realms of reincarnation in Buddhism: Deva, Asura, Human, Animal, Preta, and Naraka. Each of these \"paths\" represents one of the realms a being may be reborn into after death, determined by the accumulated karma of their past lives. While the two lower realms, Preta and Naraka, are hellish, and the two higher realms, Deva and Asura, are heavenly, all six are considered to be realms of suffering, as they perpetuate Sa\u1e43s\u0101ra, the cycle of reincarnation; the only way to break this cycle and ascend to a higher state of existence is to attain enlightenment.\nThe Outer Path, derived from the Sanskrit term T\u012brthika, refers to any doctrine that \"treads the outer path\" to enlightenment. This is opposed to the teachings of orthodox Buddhism, the Naid\u014d (\u5185\u9053, literally meaning: Inner Path), and is thus considered misguided and heretical."}
{"jutsu_name": "Six Paths Senjutsu", "jutsu_type": "Senjutsu", "jutsu_description": "Six Paths Senjutsu is a special form of senjutsu used by Hagoromo \u014ctsutsuki \u2014 the Sage of Six Paths \u2014 as well as his younger brother, Hamura.[2] Hagoromo is able to grant Six Paths Senjutsu to others, as he did with his son, Asura, and later with his son's reincarnate, Naruto Uzumaki. It can also be obtained by becoming the jinch\u016briki of the Ten-Tails, as taking in the power of the nine tailed beasts is the same as obtaining the power of the Sage of Six Paths himself.[3]\n\nOverview[]\nSix Paths Senjutsu is suggested to have a connection with the pattern that appears on the user's back when it is used, consisting of a Rinnegan-like marking above nine magatama, which resembles the pattern on the back of Hagoromo's robe.[1] The pattern that appeared on Obito Uchiha's back differed slightly from that of other known users, with the Rinnegan-like marking itself being shaped into a magatama.[4]\nAs a form of senjutsu, this ability grants similar benefits to Sage Mode, though the user's sensing capabilities are increased to a far greater extent, to the point where they can even sense shadows in the invisible world of Limbo.[5] They also gain a complete comprehension of chakra, including the ability to use all five basic nature transformations and make perfect use of Yin\u2013Yang Release,[6] as well as an almost unconscious mastery of the floating ability used by the Sage of Six Paths.[7] When one awakens Six Paths Senjutsu, they also obtain a number of Truth-Seeking Balls.[8]\n\n    Obito's unique pattern.  \nAs the Ten-Tails' jinch\u016briki, Obito and Madara Uchiha displayed several other unique abilities, though it is unknown if these apply to Six Paths Senjutsu users in general. The two were entirely immune to the effects of ninjutsu, only being vulnerable to senjutsu and taijutsu,[9] though techniques utilising Six Paths Power could also damage them.[10] They also possessed an extraordinary healing factor, capable of fully recovering from attacks that destroyed large portions of their bodies within seconds,[11] with Madara even claiming to be immortal.[12] Though taijutsu is viable, the sheer durability of Six Paths users means only techniques of the highest level have noticeable effect; Madara was merely pushed back by Daytime Tiger without harm.[13] Obito was capable of producing chakra arms from the protrusions on his back, which were powerful enough to tear through the Four Red Yang Formation with ease.[14] Despite not previously possessing the kekkei genkai, Madara was able to use a Storm Release technique,[15] which he accomplished due to having Six Paths Power.[16]\nNaruto is able to make use of Six Paths Senjutsu while in his Six Paths Sage Mode, a form which he received from Hagoromo.[7] When Naruto used this mode in conjunction with his chakra cloak during the Fourth Shinobi World War, he wore a unique shroud with the pattern associated with Six Paths Senjutsu on its back.[1] According to Sasuke Uchiha, the Truth-Seeking Balls Naruto used in this form utilised what he called \"Six Paths Sage Chakra\" (\u516d\u9053\u306e\u4ed9\u4eba\u30c1\u30e3\u30af\u30e9, Rikud\u014d no Sennin Chakura), which allowed them to damage Madara's shadow.[17]"}

The first three seals will light the seal up, allow the user to levitate, and create a barrier. The barrier will repel things from the outside, although M\u014dry\u014d managed to enter at the cost of the life of his host, Yomi. Also, the spheres inside the circle will begin to revolve around the circle.\nThe next nine seals will cause the gate-like seal leading to M\u014dry\u014d's body to rise above the ground. This gate seems to be laid on its back.\nThe final six seals will release the seal on M\u014dry\u014d's body, and it becomes accesible (to M\u014dry\u014d). After reclaiming his body, M\u014dry\u014d managed to break the barrier around the seal, as he mentions Yomi did not have the ability to do so.\nThe true effect of the sealing is that the user and the target being sealed will merge into one being. So that neither parties can utilise their chakra, the two minds are combined into one. Then one must absorb the other, as M\u014dry\u014d did with Miroku (this gave to the rise of M\u014dry\u014d in the first place, who was born from the darkness inside the hearts of people), and neither the user nor target can leave the shrine until this happens. M\u014dry\u014d could not do the same with Shion due to the bell which contained the stone where Miroku sealed all of her powers into. Sacrifice is not really necessary, as the movie suggests that Miroku used this technique twice to seal M\u014dry\u014d's body on opposite regions. Once completed, the tomb will store the victim for eternity.\nShion, however, knew nothing about this, instead believing the sealing technique will simply seal the demon away."}

{"jutsu_name": "Shield of Sand", "jutsu_type": "Ninjutsu", "jutsu_description": "The Shield of Sand is the first part of Gaara's \"Absolute Defence\", his Armour of Sand being the second.\n\nOverview[]\nWhen Gaara was a child, his uncle, Yashamaru, told him that the Shield of Sand was the product of his mother, Karura. Karura's love for Gaara was so great that, in death, her spirit possessed the sands and used them to protect him.[2] Later that same day, Yashamaru, under orders of the Fourth Kazekage, tried to assassinate Gaara. After his attack failed, Yashamaru told Gaara that he lied earlier: Karura did not love Gaara; she hated him.[3] The Shield of Sand, said Yashamaru, was a result of Shukaku (sealed within Gaara) using the sand to keep Gaara, and thus itself, safe.[4] It isn't until many years later that the Fourth Kazekage confesses to Gaara that he ordered Yashamaru to lie: Karura truly did love Gaara and the Shield of Sand truly is her doing.[5]\nThe Shield of Sand reacts to any attack against Gaara, even those Gaara himself is not aware of. When he's about to be physically harmed in any way, the Shield of Sand moves between him and the threat in order to block it. Though most often used in shielding Gaara from enemies, the sand also protects him from self-inflicted injury.[2] The Shield of Sand is automatic, requiring nothing from Gaara to use and thus meaning it can operate indefinitely.[6] Because the shield is formed from sand that's been seeped in Gaara's chakra, it has a very fast response time, too fast for most enemies to overcome.[7] Some, such as Rock Lee and Sasuke Uchiha, are fast enough to outpace the sand, striking Gaara before it's able to shield him; it is against opponents such as these that he relies on his Armour of Sand for defence.[8][9] The combination of the armour and shield is an effective one, enabling Gaara to go years without the slightest injury.[10]\nThe Shield of Sand can protect Gaara against a great variety of threats, at different times defending him from kunai,[2] exploding tags,[3] Senbon Shower,[11] taijutsu,[10] Shikotsumyaku,[12] Explosive Clay,[7] and Amaterasu,[13] to name only a few. The sand itself is very good at absorbing the force from attacks, and so it is rarely even misshapen from the impact. On those infrequent occasions when attacks do push against the shield, it places enough of a buffer between it and Gaara to stop the blow before it reaches him.[12] Only incredibly fast, piercing attacks, notably the Chidori, have been shown to actually break through the Shield of Sand and injure Gaara.[14]\n\n    Karura manifesting as the shield.  \nEven though the Shield of Sand ordinarily acts independently of Gaara, he is able to exert some control over it if he chooses. He can fully surround himself with the shield, eliminating the chance of it being bypassed through sheer speed. While he does this, he relies on his Third Eye to see what's going on outside,[15] and then forms spikes from the shield to keep approaching enemies away. In Part I, Gaara usually enters this sphere of sand while preparing to enter Tailed Beast Mode.[14] In Gaara Hiden, Gaara uses his Magnet Release to mix \"sparkling metal particles\" into the Shield of Sand, fortifying it against attacks that would otherwise penetrate it. Even Karura's will sometimes influences the Shield of Sand, shaping it into her likeness as it protects Gaara to remind him of her.[5]"}

They can then attack the same or several targets simultaneously and at the same time snatch away their ability to move by sewing them stuck with the shadow threads. Because it is a physical attack, it is impossible to capture someone without harming them, but on the other hand, since the speed of invocation and the time of duration are excellent, it can be used when urgent restraint is required.\nThis technique is usually used to go through the target and capture them, but depending on the opponent, it can also be used as an attack to bring them down. This special characteristic finds its greatest effect when used as logistical support.

{"jutsu_name": "Shadow Imitation Technique", "jutsu_type": "Hiden, Ninjutsu", "jutsu_description": "The Shadow Imitation Technique is the signature technique of the Nara clan.\n\nOverview[]\nThe user manipulates their shadow across a surface to merge it with a target or targets' shadow. The user can stretch their shadow however they wish in order to accomplish this goal, but they are limited by their shadow's surface area; if a target can move far enough away from the Shadow Imitation's user, they are theoretically safe from it. But there are ways around this: the user's shadow can freely move within other shadows, extending its range;[2] Shikamaru Nara frequently uses flash bombs, either to briefly extend his own shadow or to extend his targets'.[3] Shikamaru Hiden clarifies that a user must have a shadow to manipulate, and so the Shadow Imitation cannot be used in utter darkness.\nOnce a user merges their shadow with a target's, the target cannot move on their own other than to talk. The only movements they are able to make are those that the user makes: if the user walks forward, the target walks forward; if the user raises their right hand, the target raises their right hand.[4] Nara tend to wear their shuriken holsters in atypical locations so that, when they reach for and throw shuriken, their targets will reach for and throw nothing.[5] Although most often used against opponents, the Shadow Imitation Technique can be used to save allies, freezing them in physically impossible positions so that they won't trigger booby traps[6] or causing them to cling to sheer surfaces with no means of support.[7] At times, the Shadow Imitation's mimicry is two-way, as if a third-party forces the target to make a move, the user will be forced to make the same move.[8]\nKeeping a target restrained requires a great deal of chakra, making it difficult to maintain the Shadow Imitation for long periods of time; in Part II, Shikamaru can only maintain it for five minute intervals.[9] With repeated use or against multiple targets, the duration of the binding becomes shorter.[10] If a target is strong enough or if the user is weakened enough, targets can resist and even overpower the Shadow Imitation's control. When that happens, Nara will inevitably use one of their other techniques, such as the Shadow\u2013Neck Binding Technique or Shadow Sewing Technique.[11][12]\nThe Shadow Imitation Technique was previously known as the \"Leaf Secret: Shadow Bind Technique\" (\u6728\u30ce\u8449\u79d8\u4f1d\u30fb\u5f71\u7e1b\u308a\u306e\u8853, Konoha Hiden: Kageshibari no Jutsu, literally meaning: Tree Leaf Secret: Shadow Bind Technique), which was only capable of restricting targets' movements.[13] The imitation aspect was apparently not added until after Orochimaru defected from Konohagakure, as his Otogakure invaders did not know about it prior to the Konoha Crush.[14] Shikaku Nara still uses the old name sometimes.[13] Young Nara are initially only taught the Shadow Bind, with the Shadow Imitation not being learned until later; in the anime, being able to use the Shadow Imitation is considered a rite of passage within the Nara clan.[15]"}

{"jutsu_name": "Shadow Clone Technique", "jutsu_type": "Ninjutsu, Clone Techniques", "jutsu_description": "This article is about the jutsu. For the chapter, see Shadow Clone Technique.\n\n\n\n\nThe Shadow Clone Technique is a clone technique created by Tobirama Senju.[3]\n\nOverview[]\nThis jutsu allows the user to create one or more copies of themselves. The user's chakra is evenly divided between themselves and their clones: creating one clone will give it half the user's chakra, creating two clones will give each a third of the user's chakra, and so on. Depending on how much chakra the user has and how many clones they make, this rapid depletion of their reserves can be dangerous. Because of this, usually only those of at least j\u014dnin-level can safely use the standard Shadow Clone Technique.[4] The Multiple Shadow Clone Technique \u2013 which creates hundreds of clones to the standard version's dozens \u2013 is unsafe to the point of being forbidden. Naruto Uzumaki is an exception to this rule; because he has access to the chakra of the Nine-Tails, he can create hundreds of clones without worry.[5]\n\n    Shadow clones' identical chakra pathway systems, seen with a Byakugan.  \nUnlike the basic Clone Technique, shadow clones are physically real. They possess the same clothing, damage, and transformations as the user at the time of their creation. Most tools and weaponry are copied when the shadow clones are created,[6] but certain chakra constructs[7] and complicated technology won't be duplicated.[8] Because they are visually identical and possess the same chakra as the user, shadow clones are indistinguishable from their original, not even by d\u014djutsu;[4][9][10] Madara Uchiha can identify shadow clones using his Rinnegan.[11]\nOnce created, shadow clones can serve a number of purposes. They can be used as decoys, either by keeping opponents preoccupied or, because they can't be told apart, concealing the original's identity.[12] If enough shadow clones are created, they can simply overwhelm an opponent, pinning them down or attacking from multiple directions.[6] Shadow clones can also be used simply to assist the user, joining the user for tactics they can't do alone[13] or being sent to carry out tasks while the user is busy. Shadow clones possess all the same memories as the user, and so will react to unforeseen obstacles just as the user would in the same circumstances. Because they have their own chakra, shadow clones can perform other jutsu, including making more shadow clones.[14]\nShadow clones usually disperse once they are struck hard enough, but they have been shown capable of enduring injuries for a time.[15] When a clone's task is completed, it can disperse itself or be dispersed by its user. Once dispersed, the clone's experiences and remaining chakra are transferred back to the user.[16] The shared experiences make shadow clones useful for intelligence gathering: a shadow clone can be sent into hostile territory, gather information without endangering the user, and disperse when finished, thus transferring what they've learned.[17] Alternatively, shadow clones can recon an area, dispersing when they've found what they're looking for in order to let the user know the target's location.[18]\n\n     Naruto using shadow clones to accelerate his nature transformation training.  \nKakashi Hatake discovered that shadow clones can also accelerate training periods. For example, by training alongside one shadow clone for one hour, the user will have two hours' worth of training experience once the shadow clone disperses. By using hundreds of clones, training that would usually take weeks or months can be completed within a few hours.[19] But because of how much chakra it takes to create just one shadow clone, and because the training itself will likely be arduous even without shadow clones, only Naruto can train in this way.[20] Naruto is indeed able to make effective use of this shortcut, but the combined experiences come with combined mental fatigue, requiring that he take regular breaks.[21]\nAlthough they are separate, shadow clones maintain small links between themselves and their original, intended to allow the user to reestablish control when needed. Users can exploit this link to network their clones, causing changes in their own chakra to extend to all the others.[3] In certain cases, this link can work against the user, such as when pain caused by the Nine-Tails' chakra was felt by all of Naruto's shadow clones.[22] While a user and/or their clones are performing tasks that require concentration, they're unable to have more than a few shadow clones active at a time.[23][24] In the novelisation of Boruto: Naruto the Movie, Naruto is consciously aware of what all his shadow clones around Konohagakure are doing. Although this allows him to have multiple conversations simultaneously, he has difficulty focusing on any one thing and the original Naruto becomes increasingly strained the longer the shadow clones are active; he drinks coffee and energy supplements in order to remain alert, but as soon as his concentration falters his shadow clones will all disperse."}

For the episode of the same name, see Sealing Technique: Phantom Dragons Nine Consuming Seals.\n\n\n\n\nThe Sealing Technique: Phantom Dragons Nine Consuming Seals is a technique that was used by Pain and the other members of Akatsuki to forcibly seal a tailed beast [2] or to extract a still-living jinch\u016briki's tailed beast chakra into the Demonic Statue of the Outer Path. The technique took three full days to complete if nine of the Akatsuki members were present. Zetsu stated that if there are fewer people to perform the technique, it would take a while longer.[3]\nTo prepare for the technique, Pain would summon the Demonic Statue, after which each member would then stand on one of its fingertips, corresponding to their specific ring finger. When performed, this technique caused the bit to fall out of the mouth of the statue. Each of the Akatsuki members would then concentrate, causing the kanji of their rings to appear on the nail of the finger they were standing on. Nine dragon-like effigies then poured from the statue's mouth, surrounded the captured host, and painfully removed the tailed beast from them. In the case of an unsealed tailed beast, the same thing happened to the beast itself, and still took as much time as if it were sealed. After the process was complete, the beast was sealed within the statue, and one of the statue's nine eyes opened. The host would die due to the removal of their tailed beast. There is a numerical order, with the Nine-Tails needing be sealed last, or the statue would shatter.[4]\nHowever, with Nagato now dead, Tobi claimed that they would need a new pawn to synchronise with the Demonic Statue in order to seal the Eight-Tails and the Nine-Tails.[5] Though Nagato intended to use it for peace in the form of a weapon of mass destruction to keep governments in line, the technique was created for Madara Uchiha's Eye of the Moon Plan, as Obito was tasked with ensuring that the Demonic Statue of the Outer Path and the tailed beasts would become the Ten-Tails once more.\n\nSee Also[]\nSummoning: Demonic Statue of the Outer Path\nTail Releasing Method\nTailed Beast Removal Technique\nReferences[]\n\n\u2191 Sha no Sho, Page 294\n\n\u2191 Naruto chapter 329, page 8-9\n\n\u2191 Naruto chapter 419, page 11\n\n\u2191 Naruto chapter 353, page 5\n\n\u2191 Naruto chapter 450, page 9"}

He then opens his right chest compartment to emit more than a hundred chakra strings, which reach into the scroll. From the scroll, more than a hundred puppets wearing red cloaks emerge.\nAs even the most elite of puppeteers cannot control more than ten puppets a time (one per finger), this technique is proof of Sasori's superiority with regard to the Puppet Technique. Also, normally a puppet's movement is dependent on the will of the user, and as such there will be a time lag between the user's commands and the puppet's response. However, since these hundred puppets are directly connected to Sasori's core, there is no time lag between Sasori's will and the puppets' movements.\nSasori stated that he brought down an entire country (Land of This in the anime) with this technique. Many of the puppets, however, were destroyed during Sasori's battle with Chiyo and Sakura Haruno, although they did manage to destroy some of Chiyo's White Secret Technique: The Chikamatsu Collection of Ten Puppets. While these one hundred puppets lacked teamwork, they apparently used sheer attrition and numbers to overwhelm their opponents. Even when they decrease in numbers they do not become less dangerous as it merely allows Sasori to focus more on the remaining puppets. \nAs with all of Sasori's puppets, all the weapons wielded are coated in his special poison, which would kill the victims after three days of painful paralysis.\nIn the anime, Sasori was shown using this technique while inside Hiruko.[2]"}

{"jutsu_name": "Redaku Reincarnation Ninjutsu", "jutsu_type": "Ninjutsu, Reincarnation Ninjutsu", "jutsu_description": "This reincarnation ninjutsu is one of the many subjects documented at the centuries-old Astronomy Research Institute, an archive of knowledge for the Land of Redaku. A few years prior to the events of Sasuke Retsuden, Zans\u016bru, an archaeologist, deciphered enough of the relevant research to learn how to use this technique. However, because he was not a ninja, he recruited Jiji to perform it on his behalf. A few decades prior to this, Orochimaru visited the Institute to research this technique, ultimately stealing a few of the more valuable documents for his own purposes and using what he learned to improve upon Tobirama Senju's Impure World Reincarnation.\n\nOverview[]\nThis technique is similar to the Impure World Reincarnation in many ways, to the point that Sasuke Uchiha initially believes they are the same. Zans\u016bru insists that the Impure World Reincarnation is merely a regional variant. Like the Impure World Reincarnation, this technique brings back souls of the dead using living sacrifices; Jiji exclusively reincarnates dinosaurs (more commonly called \"dragons\"), but also planned to reincarnate a human, Margo, until he found out that she wasn't actually dead. Jiji summons a dinosaur's soul using its fossilised remains and places its soul in the body of the live sacrifice: a chicken, one of the closest extant relatives of dinosaurs. Dust and ash encase the chicken's body, giving it the same size and appearance as the dinosaur had in life.\nThe dinosaur's reincarnated body retains all the physical skills it had when it was alive. In the novel, it also has the added advantage of being immortal; it can be damaged, but its body will repair itself indefinitely regardless of severity. Not all wounds heal at the same speed, with burns being observed to still linger after several days. Unlike the humans reincarnated with the Impure World Reincarnation, who don't seem fazed by injuries, the dinosaurs reincarnated with this technique still feel pain. Yet because they can't die, they must suffer through any injuries that would ordinarily kill them until their body is healed. This detail draws empathy from Sasuke, prompting him to avoid injuring the dinosaurs when possible: he believes Amaterasu could be used to \"kill\" the dinosaurs, burning them with undying flames and rendering them incapacitated, but decides not to try it so as not to subject them to the prolonged pain that would cause. However in the anime adaptation this jutsu lacks most of the immortality advantages. The reincarnated beings bleed and can be killed with a serious enough damage.\nHow the user controls the reincarnated is never made clear, only that there are no talismans placed in the skulls as is done with the Impure World Reincarnation. The user's control over those they reincarnate is great enough that it can't be overcome with standard genjutsu. Sasuke is able to somewhat erode the control over one dinosaur, Men\u014d, by speaking to him kindly, refusing to harm him, and by offering to return him to the afterlife, something that Men\u014d wants. This momentarily allows him to establish control over Men\u014d with a genjutsu, which he then makes permanent by channelling his chakra into Men\u014d's body to overwrite Jiji's control.\nHaving control of a reincarnated form grants certain advantages. Information gathered by the reincarnated can be instantly passed along to their controller, such as to help the controller locate somebody they're searching for. Conversely, the controller can pass some of their chakra to the reincarnated, enhancing their strength: Men\u014d, a juvenile of his species, is able to overpower an adult of the same species because he has access to Sasuke's chakra. Control of one or more reincarnated subjects can be granted to non-users - as Jiji does to Zans\u016bru - but these non-users cannot give commands that are too complicated. Furthermore, new commands will immediately override previous commands regardless of potential consequences; Zans\u016bru at one point commands a flying dinosaur to let him ride it, but later gives the same dinosaur a new command unrelated to being ridden, causing Zans\u016bru to fall off and die upon impact with the ground. If and when the non-user dies, any commands they gave are rescinded and the original user's most recent commands take effect again.\nTo release this technique, the user performs the same hand seals that are used to initiate it in the first place, thus freeing the souls (even those under the control of another) from their reincarnated bodies. The souls do not immediately return to the afterlife, instead lingering in their bodies for a few moments; this brief delay gives Sasuke and Men\u014d a chance to exchange farewells. One dinosaur is even shown clinging to its reincarnated body, using the brief window of no longer being controlled to attack Jiji, vengeance for having brought it back to the living world. Once the souls do finally depart, their body disintegrates back into the dust and ash that they were made of."}

For information on the character, see Preta Path.\n\n\n\n\nThe Preta Path (\u9913\u9b3c\u9053, Gakid\u014d) grants the user the ability to absorb chakra in any form. Pain channelled the Preta Path through the corpse of a Kusagakure shinobi.\nThis ability is primarily defensive in nature as it is capable of absorbing chakra from an individual through physical contact. In addition to this, the Preta Path is able to absorb ninjutsu-based techniques that are pure chakra or chakra based, thereby nullifying their effect. It doesn't absorb physical attacks, like Gaara's sand, but does drain the sand's chakra.[1] This is done by forming a barrier around the user's entire body, allowing them to absorb attacks from all directions.\nAlthough the ability is able to absorb senjutsu chakra, the user is still vulnerable to the effects of turning into a stone statue from absorbing too much of it.\nDuring the Fourth Shinobi World War, Nagato used the Preta Path to absorb Killer B's chakra while he was in his Version 2 form. He then apparently used the chakra to revitalise his body to its state before it was emaciated by the Demonic Statue of the Outer Path. It also restored his hair colour back from white to red, as well as the damage done to his legs. However, presumably due to loss of muscle memory, he was not able to use the legs completely.[2]\n\nInfluences[]\nIn Buddhism, the Preta realm (also known as the Hungry Ghost realm) is a reincarnation based on strong possessiveness and desire which were cultivated in a previous life or lives. The Preta are humanoid creatures which are perpetually hungry and thirsty, but are unable to satisfy themselves, living lives similar to those of hopeless addicts trying to appease their unyielding hunger. In appearance, the Preta are deathly pale, emaciated figures, which contrasts with Pain's Preta Path's hefty stature. In Hinduism Preta could also mean ghosts this also relates to the technique the Preta path uses. \n\nReferences[]\n\n\u2191 Naruto chapter 560, page 14\n\n\u2191 Naruto chapter 550, pages 17-18"}

For information on the character, see Naraka Path.\n\n\n\n\nThe Naraka Path (\u5730\u7344\u9053, Jigokud\u014d) grants the user two main abilities: interrogation and restoration, by using the King of Hell. Pain channelled the power of the Naraka Path through the body of a priest.\nThe Naraka Path ability makes heavy use of the King of Hell. The King of Hell is a large head which sprouts out of the ground surrounded by purple flames. It also possesses the Rinnegan as well as the shared field of vision along with the other summons.[2]\nTo interrogate, the Naraka Path need only catch hold of a person, causing the King of Hell to appear before them. With the victim seemingly paralysed, the Naraka Path begins questioning them. After answers are given, the King of Hell will unzip its mouth to release tendril-like arms and would draw out an apparition of the victim's life force energy in the form of an enlarged tongue. The King of Hell would then proceed to pass its judgement. If the person was lying or refused to answer the questions, the King of Hell would remove their tongue and consume it, apparently killing them. However, if they told the truth, they would be spared, although left extremely exhausted. \nThe second ability the Naraka Path possessed is the ability to repair any damage. To do so the Naraka Path has the King of Hell ingest the damaged body with its tendril-like arms into its mouth, then, after some time, the destroyed body will emerge from its mouth, completely rejuvenated. It did this for example to the Asura Path after it was destroyed by Ch\u014dji and Ch\u014dza Akimichi. With its restorative abilities, the Naraka Path can easily be regarded as the most valuable body if the Six Paths of Pain is being used through six different bodies. During formation, Nagato puts the Naraka Path at the rear behind the sentimental Deva Path with the other four taking the front lines. \nKabuto Yakushi stated that a Naraka Path user can transport bodies and souls using the King of Hell.[3]\n\nInfluences[]\nNaraka (Sanskrit: \u0928\u0930\u0915) is the Sanskrit word for the underworld. In Hinduism it is a place where souls are sent for the expiation of their sins. Yama is the Lord of Justice and the King of Hell. He assigns appropriate punishments to living beings after death. For example, he might immerse them in boiling oil. If you lie to him, he will rip out your tongue.\nIn Buddhism, the Naraka realm, or \"hell realm\", is a plane of rebirth, based on Karma (actions of body, speech, and mind) built up in a previous life or lives. There are various Naraka, each containing beings that are tormented until their Karma has achieved its full and satisfactory results. The beings can then be reborn into a higher plane.\nThe Naraka are superficially similar to the Christian hell or purgatory, although there are many significant differences.\nReferences[]\n\n\u2191 Fourth Databook, page 254\n\n\u2191 Naruto chapter 422, page 4\n\n\u2191 Naruto chapter 551, page 8"}

If too much chakra is sent into the body, this can disrupt the body's circulation, putting it into a comatose state.[1]\nBecause of the level of chakra control required to safely use this technique, few medical-nin can actually perform it;[1] when Sakura Haruno is learning how to use it, she's shown practising on a fish.[3] When Sarada Uchiha practised it on a fish, she sent too much chakra and caused it to eventually burn up.[4] The anime states that the different hidden villages have all developed their own applications for this technique that are unknown to other villages; in Kirigakure's case, its medics can use it as a remedy for seasickness.[5]"}

Creating even a single shadow clone will require half of a user's chakra, for which reason the normal Shadow Clone Technique is generally only safe to use for j\u014dnin.[2] Because of how many clones are created with the Multiple Shadow Clone Technique, the chakra cost is far greater, rendering it unsafe to use for most people other than the Hokage. For this reason, the First Hokage declared it forbidden and hid it away in the Scroll of Seals. Naruto Uzumaki is among the few exceptions to this rule because of the sheer amount of chakra he has access to.[1]\nThere is no established number of created clones separating the regular Shadow Clone Technique from the Multiple Shadow Clone Technique. Average users tend to make no more than five shadow clones at a time with the regular version, whereas Naruto will make dozens, hundreds, or sometimes even a thousand with the Multiple version. Naruto Shinden: Parent and Child Day takes it in the opposite direction, showing Naruto use the Multiple Shadow Clone Technique yet only managing to make two clones because of how tired he is. Naruto sometimes doesn't even differentiate between the two techniques, simply saying \"Shadow Clone Technique\" regardless of how many clones he creates.\nWhereas a small number of clones can be useful in a variety of ways, the huge number of clones created for this technique are almost exclusively used offensively, overwhelming opponents with countless attacks from all around.[3] Naruto also utilises the Multiple Shadow Clone Technique while creating the Wind Release: Rasengan, completing years' worth of training within a matter of days.[4]"}

Using the technology provided by Kara, \u014cga can link herself and the multiple subjects she has captured together in the genjutsu. She can operate as two individuals within the genjutsu; as an older man who guides them through the experiments she had conceived and as a kunoichi named Yatsume that is also one of the subjects to further study the others. Those who die within the genjutsu do not die in the real world, but they remain unconscious in tanks they are concealed in until the genjutsu ends.\n\nExperiments[]\n\u014cga had gathered twenty-one subjects for her experiments. The following various genjutsu experiments test the subjects ability to survive. \n\nNine Lives\nBefore the first experiment, \u014cga provided a test for any one of the subjects to participate. She had ten cards, nine are \"death\" while one was \"life\", and if the participant picks the \"life\" card, they live. A Kirigakure shinobi participated in this test, randomly picking a \"death\" card which resulted in him being killed by \u014cga.\n\nCollapse\nFor the first experiment, \u014cga placed the now twenty subjects on a crumbling platform in the middle of an abyss. The subjects are to reach a higher platform in order to survive. With the help of Kiseru, those who were not shinobi were able to reach it with ladders placed on the top.\n\n\n\nSubjects\nOutcome\n\n\nAnaguma\nDropped to his death by Rokuro\n\n\nBatta\nProceeded to the next experiment\n\n\nBoruto Uzumaki\nProceeded to the next experiment\n\n\nFug\u014d\nProceeded to the next experiment\n\n\nKakesu\nDropped to her death\n\n\nKiseru Gankubi\nProceeded to the next experiment\n\n\nNamua\nProceeded to the next experiment\n\n\nRokuro\nProceeded to the next experiment\n\n\nShamo\nProceeded to the next experiment\n\n\nUnnamed Kusagakure shinobi\nProceeded; killed by Rokuro in the intermission for being an undercover Outer\n\n\nUnnamed female civilian 1\nDropped to her death\n\n\nUnnamed female civilian 2\nProceeded to the next experiment\n\n\nUnnamed female civilian 3\nProceeded to the next experiment\n\n\nUnnamed female civilian 4\nProceeded to the next experiment\n\n\nUnnamed male civilian 1\nDropped to his death\n\n\nUnnamed male civilian 2\nProceeded to the next experiment\n\n\nUnnamed male civilian 3\nProceeded to the next experiment\n\n\nUnnamed male civilian 4\nDropped to his death\n\n\nUnnamed male civilian 5\nDropped to his death\n\n\n\"Yatsume\"\nProceeded to the next experiment\n\n\nLight\nIn the second experiment, \u014cga warped the remaining subjects in a dark room with candles. The objective is to keep the candles from going out before they reach the goal, otherwise the one whose candle is extinguished will die, with their life force connected to it. The subjects must traverse into a desert with an active sandstorm, which makes it difficult to keep the candles from going out. To extend the flame and prevent their candles from melting, Boruto, Shamo, \"Yatsume\", Kiseru and Namua combined theirs, keeping them all alive. However, Rokuro, Batta and F\u016bgo, who instructed the latter, claimed theirs from the remaining subjects, stocking up their candles.\n\n\n\nSubjects\nOutcome\n\n\nBatta\nProceeded to the next experiment\n\n\nBoruto Uzumaki\nProceeded to the next experiment\n\n\nFug\u014d\nProceeded to the next experiment\n\n\nKiseru Gankubi\nProceeded to the next experiment\n\n\nNamua\nProceeded to the next experiment\n\n\nRokuro\nProceeded to the next experiment\n\n\nShamo\nProceeded to the next experiment\n\n\nUnnamed female civilian 2\nKilled by Batta\n\n\nUnnamed female civilian 3\nCandle extinguished by Rokuro\n\n\nUnnamed female civilian 4\nCandle extinguished\n\n\nUnnamed male civilian 2\nCandle extinguished\n\n\nUnnamed male civilian 3\nKilled by Batta\n\n\n\"Yatsume\"\nProceeded to the next experiment\n\nPressure\nIn the third experiment, the subjects are sent to an empty room. There is a red button on one of the walls that needed to be pressed, which revealed spikes concealed in the ceiling. The objective is to find hidden hiding spots for the subjects to hide in to avoid being crushed. However, there is only one concealed spot for the subjects to hide in that is only room for one. Fug\u014d claimed this spot, while Boruto and Batta located a weak point in the room's floor to expose in order for the subjects to hide. There was no casualties in this experiment and everyone proceeded to the next experiment.\n\n\n\nSubjects\nOutcome\n\n\nBatta\nProceeded to the next experiment\n\n\nBoruto Uzumaki\nProceeded to the next experiment\n\n\nFug\u014d\nProceeded to the next experiment\n\n\nKiseru Gankubi\nProceeded to the next experiment\n\n\nNamua\nProceeded to the next experiment\n\n\nRokuro\nProceeded to the next experiment\n\n\nShamo\nProceeded to the next experiment\n\n\n\"Yatsume\"\nProceeded to the next experiment\n\nSum\nIn the fourth experiment, \u014cga provided eight red envelopes to the subjects and warped them to a rocky terrain, where they are all separated from each other. Contained within the envelopes are numbers ranging from 1 to 8. The objective is to fight the subjects for their cards in order to have a passing score of 7 or more. Whoever possesses a 7 from the start simply needs to reach the goal without being targeted by others. The subjects must have the required score within two hours or they fail, regardless if they have the required number.\n\n\n\nSubjects\nOutcome\n\n\nBatta\nKilled by \"Yatsume\"\n\n\nBoruto Uzumaki\n\"Killed\" by Kiseru; proceeded to the final experiment\n\n\nFug\u014d\nKilled by \"Yatsume\"\n\n\nKiseru Gankubi\nRevealed as an Outer double agent for Konohagakure; sacrificed himself\n\n\nNamua\nSuccumbed to injuries by Rokuro\n\n\nRokuro\nProceeded to the final experiment\n\n\nShamo\nKilled by Kiseru\n\n\n\"Yatsume\"\nProceeded to the final experiment\n\nFinal Experiment\nBeing an Anbu working undercover as an Outer for Kara, Kiseru helped Boruto seemingly escape the labyrinth genjutsu. However, \u014cga set up one final experiment for the remaining subjects. The goal was to supposedly escape \u014cga's lair, which appeared reminiscent to Kara's hideout in the real world. \"Yatsume\" obtained a map and key card from the Kusa Outer that Rokuro killed in the previous genjutsu to help the remaining three navigate the labyrinth. There were also traps within the labyrinth, even puppets of \u014cga's male persona. \nWhen Boruto and \"Yatsume\" went further, the latter dropped her disguise and revealed herself as the real \u014cga. Impressed with Boruto navigating through all her experiments, \u014cga provided the means to end the genjutsu by killing her and removing the Illusion scroll in the real world that kept the genjutsu active for the other subjects. However, \u014cga dying in the genjutsu would also result in her being comatose in the real world. With being given a reason to live by Boruto, they broke out of the genjutsu together and \u014cga ended the genjutsu herself for the rest of the subjects.\n\n\n\nSubjects\nOutcome\n\n\nBoruto Uzumaki\nEscaped the genjutsu\n\n\nRokuro\nKilled by \u014cga puppet\n\n\n\"Yatsume\"\nRevealed to be \u014cga; woken by Boruto in the real world and ended the genjutsu\n\nSee Also[]\nGenjutsu Communication\nEngraved Tsukuyomi\nInfinite Tsukuyomi"}

Eventually, Orochimaru cancelled the project out of disinterest, but Amachi managed to finalise it against his sponsor's abandonment, applying the process onto himself.\nThe experiment left parts of Isaribi's body permanently scaled, and Amachi falsely promised that he can return her to normal, but later confessed that he had no cure for her, and instead plotted to dissect her once he was finished using her. Shinobi sent by Konohagakure believe that Tsunade will be able to reverse Isaribi's modifications.\n\nUsage[]\nThe Kaima (\u6d77\u9b54, literally meaning: Ocean Demon) transformation can also change the user's eye colour, as seen in Amachi's case. This form gives them supreme fighting skills in the water, as they can move through the water much faster than normal, as well as giving them the ability to breathe underwater. Also the scales used in this form have a steel like quality that can stop a kunai. Amachi also demonstrates that he can shoot the scales as a weapon.\nAmachi intended to use this technique's benefits to control the water routes of the world, which would restrict all the shipping businesses, effectively allowing Amachi to control the trading industries, similar to the functions of Gat\u014d Company."}

{"jutsu_name": "Izanami", "jutsu_type": "Kekkei Genkai, Genjutsu, Kinjutsu, D\u014djutsu", "jutsu_description": "The Izanami is one of the Uchiha clan's ultimate d\u014djutsu.[2]\n\nContents\n\n1 Usage\n2 Activation Requirement\n3 Effects\n4 Creation\n5 Influence\n6 References\n\n\nUsage[]\nIt is a genjutsu which affects the target through physical sensations shared between them and the user to perform the illusion.[3] Like its counterpart, in exchange for the temporary ability that it grants the user, the Sharingan with which Izanami is cast is rendered blind and loses its light forever. According to Itachi, this technique and Izanagi form a pair, but unlike the latter, which is a technique capable of altering destiny, Izanami is instead one that \"decides\" it.[4]\n\nActivation Requirement[]\n     The mechanics behind the technique.  \nTo begin the technique, after selecting any arbitrary moment, the caster uses their Sharingan to remember the physical sensations both of their body and that of their opponent's during that instant like a photograph (represented as: A). The user must then intentionally replicate the same sensation and in the same way, memorise that instant with their Sharingan (represented as: A'). Izanami overlaps and connects these two identical bodily sensations (A and A'), as well as the flow of time between them, creating an infinite loop of events that entraps the opponent's consciousness. The user can also use their Sharingan to remember multiple sensations, (represented as B, C, and so forth) and those sensations will also be used when Izanami is activated. The user also doesn't need necessarily to replicate A with A' to initiate Izanami. They can also replicate B with B' or C with C' as well. The more sensations they memorise, the better their chances would be to initiate Izanami on a person and the more sensations the victim will experience each time they repeat a loop.[5][6]\n\nEffects[]\nWhilst under the effects of the technique, the target stands motionlessly as the loop of events continually replays inside their mind.[7] Each time a loop is repeated, any physical damage incurred is reset as it were before the start of the loop, although the remains of severed appendages do not disappear.[8] The illusion of the user and anyone they were fighting alongside also have any damage reset as well such as the blindness that comes with Izanami. Despite being able to become consciously aware of their situation and act differently, the victim is unable to significantly alter or escape from the inevitable progression of these events as the illusions they're fighting will also quickly adapt to their changes in order to force the victim to experience the memorised sensations. However, because this technique was created to reprimand and save the users of Izanagi, the victim is able to escape the infinite loop if they can acknowledge the real results of their actions and in doing so, accept their fate.[9] In the anime, it's shown that there is no other way to undo this technique even by someone who has complete control over their chakra. The illusion of the caster also seems to be sentient as the illusionary Itachi was shown to be shaking his head when Kabuto futilely tried to undo the technique without accepting his fate first.[10] The illusion of the user and anyone they're fighting alongside also repeats their verbal actions such as the illusionary Itachi telling the illusionary Sasuke not to leave his side, an action Itachi did to Sasuke. The illusion of the user will continuously tell the victim to take a closer look at them and acknowledge their mistakes until they do so.\n\nCreation[]\nAccording to Itachi, there was a point in time where members of the clan abused the abilities granted by Izanagi, instead simply casting the technique as a means of escaping the undesirable results of their actions. Whilst this resulted in little issue if only one person were using Izanagi, if there were two or more casters, they would begin to fight amongst each other over personally favourable outcomes. Thus, as d\u014djutsu users were unlikely to succumb to ocular genjutsu, Izanami was created as a method to reprimand such clansmen, as well as save them from their own arrogance. By imprisoning them within an unalterable loop of events, the victim was forced to accept the reality they had created if they ever wished to escape the illusion. However, because of the dangers involved in using a technique with a built-in escape route in a real battle, Izanami became classed as a kinjutsu.[11] As such, Izanami is ironically not a genjutsu to be used on an enemy, but on a friend who has lost their way as a means of helping them find themselves again.\n\nInfluence[]\nLike the various techniques used with the Sharingan, this technique is named after a Shint\u014d goddess. In this case, it is Izanami, who, together with her brother and husband Izanagi, created the islands and other deities of Japan.\nOne of the most famous stories about Izanami tells the tale of how Izanagi goes into Yomi, the Japanese underworld, to retrieve her after she died giving birth to the Shint\u014d fire god, Kagutsuchi. In Yomi, he manages to get Izanami and they both try to leave, however, Izanagi was not supposed to look at her before they escape. Right before they reach the exit, Izanagi looks back and sees her in a decayed form. Frightened, Izanagi flees from Yomi and blocks the cave. Izanami curses Izanagi saying that she will kill 1000 people per day. In response, Izanagi says that 1500 people will be born each day. In another variation of the story, it is stated that Izanami told Izanagi to leave, however, he came back while she slept and lit a fire that revealed her decayed form, prompting him to escape out of fright, and barricade her inside with a giant boulder.\nAfter his failed attempt to get Izanami, Izanagi washed himself in a stream. As he cleaned his left eye, Amaterasu was born, as he cleaned his right eye, Tsukuyomi was born, and as he cleaned his nose, Susanoo was born.\n\nReferences[]\n\n\u2191 Fourth Databook, page 232\n\n\u2191 Naruto chapter 581, page 15\n\n\u2191 Naruto chapter 587, page 1\n\n\u2191 Naruto chapter 581, pages 15-17\n\n\u2191 Naruto chapter 587, page 2-5\n\n\u2191 Naruto: Shipp\u016bden episode 338\n\n\u2191 Naruto chapter 586, pages 14-17\n\n\u2191 Naruto chapter 586, page 18\n\n\u2191 Naruto chapter 587, page 6\n\n\u2191 Naruto: Shipp\u016bden episode 337\n\n\u2191 Naruto chapter 587, pages 3-6"}

This also makes evading the spikes nearly impossible. Even if the opponent has managed to evade getting hit, the Iron Sand spikes will have filled the entire surroundings, cutting off any escape routes. With the opponent trapped, the user is free to attack in person.\nBecause Sasori coats his Iron Sand in his lethal poison, the technique is even deadlier; if one of the spikes so much as scratches the target, it will introduce enough poison into the target's body to kill them.\n\nReferences[]\n\n\u2191 Sha no Sho, page 257\n\n\u2191 Naruto: Shipp\u016bden episode 24"}

To perform, it requires a full intensive care unit, staffed by medics with refined chakra control. The procedure lasts many hours, requiring the constant attention of the medics on staff and,[1] inevitably, requiring backup shifts to replace medics who have tired out.[2] Because of how difficult the procedure is, there is a very low chance of actually saving the patient.[1]\nThe patient is placed in the centre of the floor. A large, complicated technique formula is drawn around them, focused around the injury to be healed.[2] A sample of the patient's cells, such as a lock of their hair, is placed near the injury, to be used as a medium for the procedure. Medics take position around the formula's perimeter, notably the corners, and work together to change the medium's cellular makeup, converting it into whatever cells are required for mending the wound. This is where the technique's greatest difficulty lies, as medics must be careful to form the correct cell and then just as carefully apply it to the regenerating injury.[1]\nIn the anime, Sakura Haruno is shown using this technique by herself; she needs neither the large formula nor the medium. Instead, four formula-lines are used to restore the missing section of the body. The technique is still very chakra-taxing, as Sakura fainted after using almost all of her chakra during the operation.[3]\n\nReferences[]\n\n\u2191 1.0 1.1 1.2 1.3 T\u014d no Sho, page 247\n\n\u2191 2.0 2.1 Naruto chapter 235\n\n\u2191 Naruto: Shipp\u016bden episode 395"}

Sasuke Uchiha remarked that it came close to replicating Kaguya \u014ctsutsuki's secret techniques.[1]\nThe seal is comprised of Hashirama Senju's cells and must be surgically implanted into a compatible vessel, a process which drains a great deal of the caster's vitality, shortening their lifespan; Tanuki died right after he casted it onto his daughter. The seal itself acts as a gateway to a separate dimension that Tanuki called the underworld (\u7570\u754c, ikai), wherein dwells a legendary beast named Nue that is born the moment the seal is completed.[2]\nThe mark acts as a medium for absorbed chakra to be transferred into the Nue, nourishing it, as well as a gate through which it can be summoned. It also allows the user to create snake-like creatures out of dark chakra, which can be used in battle or parasitically attached to individuals suffering from negative emotions to continually drain their chakra, further disturbing their mental state. As Nue is fed chakra, the seal's pattern spreads and the beast quickly grows into a gigantic monster, eventually becoming a living chakra bomb that can be summoned to a location and detonated, creating an explosion large enough to destroy an entire city.\nThe principal usage of the Gozu Tenn\u014d is to send the host into enemy territory to release Nue, who will rampage as much as possible before detonating to wipe out everything, including the host.\nAs the true source of power for this technique is negative emotions, if the vessel overcomes these emotions the seal will be destroyed. When Sumire Kakei achieved this, a portion of the seal remained and migrated to her palm, allowing her to maintain her symbiotic bond with Nue.\n\nInfluence[]\nThe technique's name comes from Gozu Tenn\u014d, a Japanese deity of pestilence."}

It inflicts internal damage through attacking the body's Chakra Pathway System, subsequently injuring organs which are closely intertwined with the area of the network which has been struck. To do this, the user surgically injects a certain amount of their own chakra into the opponent's chakra pathway system, causing damage to surrounding organs due to their proximity to the chakra circulatory system. Even the slightest tap can cause severe internal damage, hence the name \"gentle\" fist.\nBy employing the use of the Byakugan, an experienced user[1] can target the tenketsu, thus enhancing the havoc and control a Gentle Fist practitioner can impose upon an opponent's chakra network. These 361 nodes are key gate-keeping interceptions in the chakra circulatory network, thus forcibly opening or sealing them in whatever manner the Gentle Fist user sees fit, is a powerful tactical option to have. The affected person's chakra flow can either be increased or disrupted completely, preventing them from using techniques as seen in Neji's fight with Hinata during the Ch\u016bnin Exams, rendering her own Gentle Fist manoeuvres ineffective.\nNeji Hy\u016bga noted that any chakra-based substance can be destroyed by this technique. As seen in his fight with Kid\u014dmaru, it is done by leaking chakra from the chakra openings in one's hands and moulding it into a needle-like shape to slice through the chakra.[2] In the novel, it was shown that one can even use the Gentle Fist to counter enemy technique, carefully cutting an attack two so that it passes by harmlessly.[3] In contrast, Kid\u014dmaru managed to devise a method that prevented the chakra from being injected into the body, thus negating the main impact of the Gentle Fist through physical contact. Because Gentle Fist is mostly taijutsu, some believed users can only emit chakra from their hands due to the hands being the most mobile limbs on the body. However, users can emit chakra from any tenketsu, making binding them with chakra-based substance impossible.\nBeing a close-quarter combat style, Gentle Fist practitioners have a disadvantage against long-range fighters, as Kid\u014dmaru took full advantage of his distance weaponry to overwhelm Neji.\nBecause the chakra pathway system is invisible to the naked eye, the Byakugan is required for most techniques of this style. Since the Byakugan is unique to the Hy\u016bga clan, it has become their signature style of combat. The ability to inflict severe internal trauma with minimal external force, combined with chakra network manipulation, makes the Gentle Fist the most reputable and fearsome taijutsu style known in all of Konohagakure.[4] In contrast to this, the technique can also be used for supplementary purposes displayed when Hinata used the technique to fix Naruto Uzumaki's dislocated shoulder joint during the Fourth Shinobi World War.[5]\nDue to their possession of the Byakugan, the \u014ctsutsuki clan also practices this taijutsu form, though far more aggressive than what the Hy\u016bga clan practices. Momoshiki \u014ctsutsuki demonstrated his while fighting Naruto Uzumaki, targeting Naruto's tenketsu and internal organs to try to incapacitate him.[6]"}

It has also been shown to be performed through the Sharingan's higher evolutions: the Mangeky\u014d Sharingan and the Rinnegan.\n\nUsage[]\n     The technique utilised through the Rinnegan.  \nBy establishing eye contact with a target, the Sharingan user traps them within a genjutsu which can be exploited for one of various purposes, such as: causing instantaneous \u2014 but temporary \u2014 loss of consciousness or paralysis in the target,[2][3] forceful extraction of information,[4][5] relaying memories,[6] erasing memories,[7] removing genjutsu placed on the target by others,[8] and controlling a target's actions.[9][10]\nMembers of the Uchiha clan are particularly famous for using their Sharingan to control the Nine-Tails, so much so that Konoha quickly came to suspect Uchiha involvement in the Nine-Tailed Demon Fox's Attack.[11] Sasuke Uchiha is noted to be able to use the technique through his Rinnegan, to trap all the tailed beasts in a genjutsu with a mere glance.[12]\nThe illusions created by Genjutsu: Sharingan do not appear to have any trademark form, appearing vastly different between the same functions and even the same users. For example, Sasuke typically uses it to render targets unconscious, yet on the first occasion the target's body is pierced with large feathers,[13] on another, the target is grasped and overwhelmed by a shadowy figure,[14] and on the third the target experiences Sasuke personally stabbing them.[15]"}

This part of the technique can be cured without the use of a release command, if they defeat their inner self that is in their head.

Once this is completed and the technique is activated, the symbols converge towards and surround the cursed seal,[2] the blood acting as a chain that prevents the cursed seal from spreading.[1] Applying the Evil Sealing Method is quite painful, and recipients are likely to pass out after receiving it.[2]\nThe Evil Sealing Method can only suppress cursed seals, not remove them.[1] Its power also relies on the will of the recipient: if the recipient wants it to work, then it will fight off the cursed seal's effects as much as it can; but if the user would rather the cursed seal activated, the Evil Sealing Method will be powerless to prevent it.[2] For this reason, after Kakashi Hatake suppresses Sasuke Uchiha's Cursed Seal of Heaven, Kakashi takes efforts to train Sasuke so that he won't be tempted by the cursed seal's power, notably teaching him the Chidori.[3] This ends up not being enough for Sasuke and he willingly accepts the Cursed Seal of Heaven's influence.

Despite all this, Kakashi Hatake is able to do so, converting sections of his Earth-Style Wall that are about to be struck by lightning.

Kazuma described it as the ultimate Earth element resurrection technique.\n\nOverview[]\nBy utilising soil in the local ground, the user can revive the fallen in one of two ways.\nThe first version allows the user to seemingly continuously resurrect a large number of slain people as zombies, but with none of their rationality, physical prowess, or techniques at their disposal. They are fairly easy to destroy. If the technique is deactivated either by the user's will or if the user is killed, the zombies will immediately turn to dust.\nThe second version allows the user to bring a person back as a perfect resurrection, able to use all their skills from when they were alive, with the addition of a preset directive the person is forced to obey despite being consciously aware. Unlike the Impure World Reincarnation technique, the soul is not bound to the body, hence those resurrected cannot heal themselves and can be killed. This method requires a large amount of energy (i.e. electricity). At any time, by performing a Snake hand seal and snapping their fingers, the caster of this technique releases the resurrected targets, turning them into loose soil.\n\nReferences[]\n\n\u2191 Naruto Collectible Card Game"}

The structure expands rapidly in size when being propelled towards its intended target and traps them inside its confines. The sphere then seems to explode with a tremendous amount of force, while the exterior walls of the structure effectively restrict the size of the blast radius, resulting in the destruction of everything and anyone caught within as they are pulverised into minute particles of dust. The technique isn't limited to just affecting physical matter; it can also affect chakra-based defences, witnessed from \u014cnoki's use of it to destroy Madara Uchiha's Susanoo.[2]\n\n     Kak\u014d's large variant.  \nThe resulting damage that this technique can produce varies considerably, depending on the initial shape of the created structure. For example, when fabricated in the form of a cube, the structure possesses a relatively small blast radius, minimising the possibility for collateral damage. However, the conical version was implied to be enough to potentially destroy an entire island.[3] Additionally, it is possible to produce a much larger variant of the cube-shaped technique, which was large enough to destroy twenty-five Susanoo-clad wood clones in an instant. This cube can also be split into two after being activated, allowing for other techniques to be directed between the two halves.[4] When two similar techniques of approximately equal power collide, the pair merge into a single large spherical explosion; where everything caught within the substantial blast radius is completely pulverised.[5]\nKak\u014d has shown he could fire off the cubical version of the technique one-handed, which allows him for a rapid-fire attack (albeit the cubes do not expand upon release).[6]\n\nShape Variants[]\nThis technique can be manipulated into a diverse selection of three-dimensional structures, including cones, cylinders and cubes, with each retaining a sphere located at their centres. The size and length of it is proportional to the amount of chakra put into it. According to \u014cnoki, the differences in shape demonstrated by the users of this technique is reflective of the generational gap between them.[5]\n\nCubical variant.Drill (\u9310, Kiri)[7] variant.Cylinder (\u67f1, Ch\u016b)[7] variant.\nReferences[]\n\n\u2191 Fourth Databook, page 259\n\n\u2191 Naruto chapter 575, pages 10-11\n\n\u2191 Naruto chapter 514, pages 1-2\n\n\u2191 Naruto chapter 588, pages 14-15\n\n\u2191 5.0 5.1 Naruto chapter 546, pages 14-16\n\n\u2191 Boruto episode 87\n\n\u2191 7.0 7.1 Naruto Shipp\u016bden: Ultimate Ninja Storm Revolution"}

The continued forceful use of the tenketsu for the extraction damages the jinch\u016briki's chakra network contributing to the targeted jinch\u016briki's immobilisation and causing them pain. Others who attempt to touch the chains will be struck with a powerful electrical shock.

Techniques that suppress chakra absorption such as a cocoon made up of a network of highly refined chakra threads can slow down the rate at which the chakra is drained. The chakra absorption can be stopped completely by closing the particular tenketsu the chains are using to extract the tailed beast.\nThere is a dangerous drawback to this technique, however. If the chains are removed before properly absorbing all the tailed beast chakra, they will turn on the nearest target with that chakra, with it being the caster, ultimately sealing them.

He implanted a single receiver into each of his Six Paths of Pain, which were made into temporary jinch\u016briki. By manifesting chains from the jinch\u016briki's receivers and connecting them to his hand, he was able to bind and suppress the tailed beasts inside them in the event that they resisted his control.[5] When Naruto Uzumaki was trapped inside the Four-Tails' mouth, Obito attempted to capture him by dragging the beast inside his own body using these chains.[6] The beasts were also bound by chains within their consciousness; when the receivers were removed from their jinch\u016briki's bodies, these chains were replaced by a single larger chain connecting directly to the Demonic Statue of the Outer Path, permitting Obito to quickly reseal them into the statue.[7]\n\n     The Demonic Statue emitting chains.  \nThe Demonic Statue itself is able to emit chakra chains from its mouth.

{"jutsu_name": "Demonic Mirroring Ice Crystals", "jutsu_type": "Kekkei Genkai, Hiden, Ninjutsu", "jutsu_description": "This technique is performed with the \"cursed\" kekkei genkai of the Yuki clan. Haku creates several large mirrors out of ice, which he surrounds a target with.[1] By entering one of these mirrors,[2] Haku's reflection will appear in all of them. Haku can travel between these mirrors near-instantaneously, giving the appearance that he occupies all of them simultaneously. As such, any attacks he makes from these mirrors - usually rapid volleys of thrown senbon - can overwhelm opponents, seemingly coming from every mirror at once.[1] Using the technique requires a great deal of chakra from Haku, meaning he cannot use it indefinitely.[3] In the anime, if the mirror the user is in is broken, they can leap out of one of the fragments and continue their attack or move to another mirror.[4]\nAlthough Haku moves between the mirrors extremely quickly, to the point that Rin no Sho describes it as light speed,[1] it is still possible to track him: Sasuke Uchiha, with his undeveloped Sharingan, becomes able to follow his movements, and with enough time could even attack Haku;[3] Naruto Uzumaki, after entering an initial jinch\u016briki form, is able to dodge Haku as well.[5] Similarly, although the mirrors are quite resilient, notably not melting against standard Fire Release,[6] Naruto's jinch\u016briki form is strong enough to shatter one.[5] The mirrors will also shatter if Haku stops maintaining them.[7]\nThese exceptions aside, the Demonic Mirroring Ice Crystals is still a formidable technique. Most victims will be unable to do anything against Haku's attacks, as they are so fast and come from so many directions at once that it's impossible to see all of them. If they should try to attack Haku while he's within a mirror, he can simply move to another mirror before they've even noticed.[1] If Haku completely surrounds his victims with mirrors, such as the dome he uses against Sasuke, then they are effectively trapped; only allies working from outside the dome stand a reasonable chance of saving them.[6] Even targets who manage to keep their distance from Haku are not safe, as he can simply form a mirror next to them, allowing him to quickly travel to and attack them.[8]"}

The seal was applied on the left side of the back of both Sasuke's and Anko's necks.\nAnko received her cursed seal when she was a student of Orochimaru. She, along with nine others, were the first people to receive a cursed seal. She was the only one to survive the application, establishing the one-in-ten success rate for the procedure. Because she lacked the will to use it, her seal receded, and (in the anime) Orochimaru wiped her memory. Orochimaru was able to briefly reactivate the seal when they fought in the Forest of Death before the Third Hokage sealed it off again. It was fully removed when Sasuke used it as a medium to revive Orochimaru's consciousness and body via the Evil Releasing Method.[2]\nOrochimaru branded Sasuke with the cursed seal in the second phase of the Ch\u016bnin Exams, which took place in the Forest of Death. Orochimaru intended to have the seal corrode Sasuke's mind so that he could become his next body. Kakashi Hatake used the Evil Sealing Method to try and prevent this, but its effectiveness relied on Sasuke's choosing not to use his cursed seal. Sasuke ultimately chose to advance his seal to its second level, and went to Orochimaru with the help of the Sound Four. \nWhen Sasuke activated the second level of the seal, his skin turned dark-grey and his hair grew and turned dark blue. His eyes also turned dark grey. Additionally, he grew webbed-claw-shaped wings from his back which he could use to fly and glide, and a dark, star-shaped mark appeared across the bridge of his nose. Should any limbs be lost, Sasuke is able to replace them with snakes. During Sasuke's battle with Itachi Uchiha, he lost the cursed seal, along with Orochimaru (having earlier been absorbed into Sasuke's body), as they were removed with the Sword of Totsuka.\nAccording to Kabuto, the seal itself contains Orochimaru's chakra, which Kabuto used in order to improve the binding power of Summoning: Impure World Reincarnation. In fact, when Orochimaru was defeated, his consciousness remained split amongst the cursed seals, and Sasuke used that, along with a piece of Kabuto's modified flesh, to bring the former back to his original state and mind.[2]\n\nReferences[]\n\n\u2191 Naruto chapter 199, pages 2-3\n\n\u2191 2.0 2.1 Naruto chapter 593, page 9"}

When using this attack on a great number of enemies at once, it can effectively double as an instant defence. The body of the person touched by the Chidori will misinterpret the lightning nature as \"electrical signals from the nerves\", making its muscles contract. This causes the body to involuntarily go stiff, while at the same time receives damage. This attack can also be channelled through the ground to increase the range of the attack.[2]\n\nSee Also[]\nLightning Release: Lightning Rod\nLightning Surge\nReferences[]\n\n\u2191 Sha no Sho, page 284\n\n\u2191 Naruto chapter 384, page 11"}

The amount of chakra transferred depends solely on the user.\n\nOverview[]\nThis technique was originally created by Hagoromo \u014ctsutsuki in order to \"connect\" the spiritual energies of every living person. His intention was for it to be used to build and maintain peace through his religion of ninsh\u016b, but this technique ended up becoming another tool for war when humanity weaponised chakra. This technique is used by many shinobi, each one of them has shown to use technique in different ways. \n\nVariations[]\nCertain people, such as\u00a0Minato Namikaze and Naruto Uzumaki could also mould the transferred chakra in order to adapt it to another person's specific chakra type.[1] In the latter's case, due to Kurama's chakra, it also enveloped the recipients in a chakra cloak similar to his \"Version 1\" form, albeit with no tails.[2] Once the user transfers its chakra, he/she is able to manipulate that chakra remotely.\nKatsuyu and its summoners have a unique bond between them through Strength of a Hundred Seal and they can use Katsuyu: Immense Network Healing. Tsunade used this technique during Pain's invasion of Konoha, with Tsunade first transferring her healing chakra to Katsuyu, and then Katsuyu itself transferring it to the wounded villagers. Sakura used the same method of Tsunade with Katsuyu to heal wounded shinobi in Shinobi Alliance against Ten-Tails.[3]\nTsunade used again this technique during the five Kage's fight against Madara Uchiha to give \u014cnoki some of her chakra so that he could use a massive Dust Release: Detachment of the Primitive World Technique to defeat Madara's wood clones.[4] Sakura later used this technique to improve Obito's Kamui.\nZetsu's Spore Technique creates clones, which feed on chakra to grow are also able to transfer chakra to people they come in contact with.[5]\nDan Kat\u014d was able to use this technique as a spirit in Tsunade's consciousness to restore her chakra and Strength of a Hundred Seal.[6] Obito did something similar to give his chakra and d\u014djutsu powers to Kakashi after his body had been turned to ashes.[7]\nJ\u016bgo was able to transfer natural energy to someone thanks to his clan's unique ability.[8][9]\nTailed beasts are also able to freely share their chakra with whoever they choose, and as Kurama has noted, it is a less complicated process for them than it is for humans.[10][11]\nHagoromo \u014ctsutsuki was the first user of this technique to connect all humans living in the earth and gave the chakra to humanity besides his immediate family.[12] Hagoromo also used this technique inside of Naruto and Sasuke who are the reincarnations of Asura and Indra. He gave the power to them to defeat Madara. While using this technique, a unique entity appears behind Hagoromo with a marking reminiscent of a third eye in its forehead.[13]\nIn the anime, if the Aburame member has proper control, the kikaich\u016b are also shown able to transfer their accumulated chakra to others targets, replenishing them.[14]\nIn the anime, the Magaki Group uses this technique in a different way. First Nang\u014d sends his chakra to Benten and Ch\u016bshin, and then both of them send it along with its own to Akaboshi, greatly enhancing the power of his techniques.[15] He is able to shatter a barrier easily with his increased chakra.\nReferences[]\n\n\u2191 Naruto chapter 617, page 5\n\n\u2191 Naruto chapter 616\n\n\u2191 Naruto chapter 634, pages 7-8\n\n\u2191 Naruto chapter 588, pages 13-15\n\n\u2191 Naruto chapter 466, pages 9-11\n\n\u2191 Naruto chapter 591, page 16\n\n\u2191 Naruto chapter 688, page 2\n\n\u2191 Naruto chapter 413, page 15\n\n\u2191 Naruto chapter 618, page 13\n\n\u2191 Naruto chapter 572, page 10\n\n\u2191 Naruto chapter 609, pages 13-14\n\n\u2191 Naruto chapter 665, page 6\n\n\u2191 Naruto chapter 671, pages 14-16\n\n\u2191 Naruto: Shipp\u016bden episode 304\n\n\u2191 Naruto: Shipp\u016bden episode 144"}
{"jutsu_name": "Character Bind Technique", "jutsu_type": "Ninjutsu, Fighting Style", "jutsu_description": "The Character Bind Technique (\u5b57\u7e1b\u8853, Jibakujutsu) was a technique developed by Shiranami. By pointing his finger out at a target and writing the proper kanji in the air, this technique produces a variety of effects. \n\nKnown Words[]\nThe effects of these kanji have been shown:\n\n\u64cd, which comes from the verb \u64cd\u308b (ayatsuru), meaning \"to manipulate\". This character allows Shiranami to manipulate and control his opponent. The effect manifests when Shiranami writes the kanji in the air at the target's direction; at which point, the kanji appears on the recipient's person. That individual then becomes a subject to Shiranami's will. However, as with the Infinite Embrace, it is not absolute, since a person with tremendous chakra can easily dispel the effect.\n\u6ec5, which comes from the verb \u6ec5\u3059\u308b (messuru), meaning \"to destroy\". Shiranami uses this character to track down and destroy a message sent by carrier pigeon. Utakata destroyed the word before it could fulfil its purpose.\n\u5ca9 (iwa, rock). This character allows Shiranami to immobilise targets. In the case of clones, this dispels them.\n\u7206 (baku, explode). This character causes several explosions that can also be used to dispel clones.\n\u706b (hi, fire). This character creates a blaze of fire, which can vary in size.\n\u708e (en, flames). This character creates a large wall of fire to keep the enemies away.\n\u65ac (zan), which comes from the verb \u65ac\u308b (kiru), meaning \"to kill with a blade\".

However, due to having one's chakra suppressed, they will be unable to use jutsu.\nThe \u014ctsutsuki Clan can naturally suppress their chakra signature. A vessel which been has sufficiently changed into an \u014ctsutsuki can access this ability on instinct, without being consciously aware of its existence.

This can then be used for highly accurate incisions necessary for surgeries and anatomical dissections.[1] Unlike regular scalpels, the chakra scalpel can make cuts inside the body without actually creating an open wound, limiting the risks of an infection.\nThe chakra scalpel can also be used offensively to inflict internal damage, although it requires great precision to be effective. Because of this requirement, using the chakra scalpel offensively is highly unusual. In heated combat, even the greatest medical-nin won't be able to exert the precision needed to target the vital spots, but it can still effectively cut muscle tissues and tendons, rendering the target immobile.\nKabuto has displayed enough skill with the technique to be able to deliver fatal cuts that can target vital spots, even cutting through wood and flesh with ease. He could also sever the chakra pathway system, which prevented a jinch\u016briki from receiving chakra from their tailed-beast.

In this form, the user's combat ability is greatly enhanced; allowing the use of the clan's high-level techniques such as Butterfly Bullet Bombing, and the ability to use the chakra wings to create gusts of chakra.\nThere are two methods of entering this mode. The first is through use of the Akimichi's Three Coloured Pills, which aggressively convert all of the user's calories into chakra; if the pills are not regulated properly, the user may die from the rapid weight loss. Practised users are able to convert their calories into chakra on their own through a process known as Calorie Control (\u30ab\u30ed\u30ea\u30fc\u30b3\u30f3\u30c8\u30ed\u30fc\u30eb , Karor\u012b Kontor\u014dru); because they are in complete control of how much of their body weight is turned into chakra, it poses less of a risk to the user.\nIn the anime, it is shown that using this form without proper control will in fact greatly diminish one's performance.[2] It is also shown that even while in this slim state, the user can still perform various expansion techniques.[3]\n\nReferences[]\n\n\u2191 Fourth Databook, page 271\n\n\u2191 Boruto episode 67\n\n\u2191 Boruto episode 156"}

The spring water produced by The Hole appears to catalyse and speed up the recreation process because of the large \"life force\" flowing through it.[1] The downside to the accelerated rate at which the clone matures is that the snakes composing it have a very short lifespan, resulting in the clone splitting apart and dying after approximately 48 hours.[2]\nOnce the clone is created, Kabuto is able to gain control of it by placing a special talisman into its head. Depending on the talisman used, the clone can either become a mindless tool under Kabuto's control, with eyes possessing black sclera and white irides, or allowed to access their genetic source's personality and memories, while possessing eyes with dark grey sclera and white, snake-like irides. Clones produced through this method are also able to use any abilities possessed by their original selves, including those that they did not naturally acquire.[3] While not in battle, Kabuto stored the clones he created within large snakes, which would burst out of the ground and release their contents when needed.\nKabuto first used this technique to create a clone of Akatsuki member Hidan by placing snakes containing his DNA into the water produced by The Hole, causing them to quickly form into a humanoid shape, and then giving it life with a talisman. Later, snakes which had been ingested by Naruto Uzumaki created a clone of him upon exiting his body; a process which had greatly weakened him over the course of a day and ultimately paralysed him. Unlike the clone of Hidan, this clone did not require the insertion of a talisman to gain life and, due to the influence of Kurama's chakra, was formed in Naruto's four-tailed Version 2 state and possessed a strangely coloured body as well as a tail. The clone was also capable of resisting the control of Kabuto's talisman once it was inserted.[3]"}

But when under the influence of this technique, these signals will produce any movement other than what the brain intends. When used against most opponents, they will be unable to do something as simple as walking, much less continue fighting.[1]\nThe target can partially overcome this technique if they manage to relearn the connection between their brain and their limbs, as Kabuto Yakushi demonstrates.

Once trapped inside, an opponent is cut off from any allies and susceptible to attack, and can then be easily defeated.\n\nReferences[]\n\n\u2191 Sha no Sho, page 253"}

It has the same five second limit as the Shinra Tensei as stated by Ch\u014dji Akimichi.[2] The area of effect can be localised, so it is possible to selectively attract a target or targets without affecting the object or the structure they're connected to.[3][4] It is also possible to attract multiple targets at once, causing them to collide with each other.[4] The ability to manipulate attractive forces with this technique is granted by the Deva Path much like its counterpart Shinra Tensei.\n\nOther Media[]\nAn enhanced, \"Full Throttle\" version of Bansh\u014d Ten'in appears in Naruto Shipp\u016bden: Shinobi Rumble, called \"Bansh\u014d Ten'in: D\u014dmetsu\" (\u4e07\u8c61\u5929\u5f15\u30fb\u5c0e\u6ec5, literally meaning: Heavenly Attraction of All Creation: Guiding Destruction).\nIn Naruto Shipp\u016bden: Ultimate Ninja Impact, Nagato can also use it to lift the ground and throw it at the opponent, called \"Bansh\u014d Ten'in: Jid\u014d\" (\u4e07\u8c61\u5929\u5f15\u30fb\u5730\u52d5, literally meaning: Heavenly Attraction of All Creation: Ground Motion).\n\nInfluence[]\nThe names of Bansh\u014d Ten'in and its companion ability, Shinra Tensei, are derived from Shinra Bansh\u014d (\u795e\u7f85\u4e07\u8c61, literally meaning: Everything Covered by God), a Japanese four-character idiom and homophone variant of Shinra Bansh\u014d (\u68ee\u7f85\u4e07\u8c61, literally meaning: All-Covering Forests and Ten Thousand Things), a Buddhist idiom which has come to mean \"All Nature\" or \"All Creation\"."}

These additional appendages, as well as the user's body as a whole, are augmented with a variety of mechanical weaponry, which they can access at will. The user can fire their forearms as long-range projectiles or pull them off to reveal and fire a cluster of segmented missiles at targets. They are also able to protrude a set of flexible blades and drills or a series of mechanical tendrils from their arms, as well as quickly propel themselves forward by emitting a burst of chakra from holes in their feet. The user can also release a powerful chakra blast, which is capable of destroying numerous buildings at once, either by transforming one of their hands into a cannon or by opening the crown of their head.\nThe body through which Nagato channelled the Asura Path displayed enough raw physical power to rip Jiraiya's arm off and crush his throat with basic taijutsu, as well as to throw the Animal Path all the way into Konohagakure from the outskirts of the village. Additionally, the Asura Path was able to survive otherwise fatal damage due to its mechanised insides. All of these abilities befitted the \"warring demon\" name that the Asura Path held, whilst giving it a considerable degree of versatility.\n\n\nMechanisms[]\nThe detached hand being launched.As displayed through Nagato's Path, not only was the arm detachable, but a cluster of segmented missiles produced from within it.The arm itself could be used as a launching pad to launch the missiles.The Path's head opening up to reveal a cannon.The Path being propelled with mechanisms from the feet. The right hand also shows additional weapons being produced.Additional arms being equipped in battle.\nInfluences[]\nIn Buddhism, the Asura realm is the plane of semi-divine warring demons which people are reincarnated in due to actions based on jealousy, struggle, combat or rationalisation in a previous life, and though powerful, live in constant violence and conflict to which there is no resolution nor peace. Following a common depiction of Asura, this ability allows the user to possess six arms and three faces, each of which display a different emotion. Like Deva, Asura are also a race of supernatural beings. They are also featured in Hinduism as divine beings, and are known to live a life pursuing power, while indulgent and representative of materialistic and carnal pleasures. Both depictions play in the abilities of the Asura Path.\nIt also draws inspiration from Hinduism, where Asuras in mythology purportedly had the ability (called Astra) to use magical equivalents to modern day biological missiles.\n\nReferences[]\n\n\u2191 Fourth Databook, page 257\n\n\u2191 Naruto chapter 551, page 6"}

For other uses, see Animal Path (disambiguation).\n\n\n\n\nThe Animal Path (\u755c\u751f\u9053, Chikush\u014dd\u014d) grants a Rinnegan user the ability of summoning various animals and creatures to aid it in battle. These creatures appear to be immortal, as they were killed and later summoned again. Worthy of note, summoning creatures through the Animal Path require no blood sacrifice or hand seals. The Animal Path can also summon people using hand signs, such as the case of Nagato's Paths and Konan. Tactics-wise, the Animal Path's primary role in battle appears to consist of overwhelming multiple opponents with a barrage of summons.\nIn the case of Nagato, having originally channelled the Animal Path through the corpse of a F\u016bma clan shinobi and then the corpse of Ajisai in life, the creatures summoned appear to have undergone the same modifications as his Paths of Pain, having chakra receivers embedded in their bodies. Nagato also tends to send the Animal Path first into battle to throw enemies off about the number of enemies they are really facing. As they also display the Rinnegan, the creatures serve as extensions of Nagato.[1] During the Fourth Shinobi World War, Nagato used his summons for transport before being rejuvenated to move on his own power. \n\nSummons\n\nGiant Drill-Beaked Bird\nGiant Multi-Headed Dog\nGiant Snake-Tailed Chameleon\nGiant Panda\nGiant Ox\nGiant Rhino\nGiant Crustacean\nGiant Centipede\nThe other Paths of Pain\nKonan\nInfluences[]\nBuddhists believe that animals inhabit a different dimension separated from humans not spatially but mentally; an unhappy plane of rebirth which revolves around fear, instinct and survival of the fittest, suffered by those animals that work for humans and, above all, by those ignorant to what is happening to them.\n\nReferences[]\n\n\u2191 Naruto chapter 551, page 6"}

It was a technique designed by \u014cnoki to protect the village from attackers while lowering the number of casualties.\n\nOverview[]\nThe Akuta creates living organisms made of clay[1] that are weaponised. They are able to phase through the earthen ground for travel and drag their enemies with them, as well as extend their limbs.[2] While they have no fear, they have a limited lifespan and intelligence, being capable of obeying instructions and communicating with fabrications.[3] Their masks are their weakness, the destruction of which would lead to their deaths.\nWhile deemed to have no will, this was prove false in Akkun's existence, a small Akuta who gained affection to Inojin Yamanaka, and even defied its comrades to protect him. Kirara deemed Akkun as a defect for such traits. When the fabrications decided to take matters into their own hands, the Akuta produced even went against \u014cnoki's orders.\n\nDevelopment[]\n\u014cnoki created this technique in response to a missing-nin's attack claiming the lives of many young shinobi. When he first demonstrated it, they suddenly disobeyed him and attempted to attack the audience, which led Kurotsuchi to reject the technique's further development. Despite this, \u014cnoki continued to hone this technique in secrecy, eventually managing to create more obedient creatures.\nIwagakure housed an underground facility where more Akuta are being mass produced. It was later destroyed by Konohamaru Sarutobi.\n\nReferences[]\n\n\u2191 Boruto episode 88\n\n\u2191 Boruto episode 82\n\n\u2191 Boruto episode 89"}

Using Inoichi's telepathic abilities, Shikaku was able to relay the formation to every member of the alliance at once.\nThe first step would executed by the Kumo-nin, who would use Lightning Release: Lightning Illusion Flash of Lightning Pillar to temporarily blind the opponents and Storm Release: Laser Circus to create a cloud of dust. Next, Suna-nin would use their Wind Release: Air Current Wild Dance to manipulate the dust to further obscure the Uchiha's vision, while Aburame clan members and Kiri-nin would use their Insect Jamming Technique and Hiding in Mist Technique to impair their sensory skills. \nThe second step, to restrain the Ten-Tails, would see the Iwa-nin create a large sink hole with their Earth Release: Great Moving Earth Core, with their lava users covering the beast with quicklime, mixing it with the Kiri-nin's water. Konoha's Sarutobi clan would then heat this mixture into concrete, trapping the Ten-Tails.\nWith the Ten-Tails restrained, the rest of the alliance would rush Madara and Obito using taijutsu, having coordinated with Naruto to exploit their weaknesses."}
